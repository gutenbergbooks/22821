<h2>Publisher's Explanatory Note</h2>


<p>These brief articles are sparks struck as it were
from the anvil of events. They were written on
trains, in hotels, in the intervals between public
addresses. During the past year beginning October
1, 1917, Dr. Hillis, in addition to his
work in Plymouth Church, and as President of
The Plymouth Institute, has visited no less than
one hundred and sixty-two cities, and made some
four hundred addresses on "The National Crisis,"
"How Germany Lost Her Soul," "The Philosophy
of the German Atrocities," and "The Pan-German
Empire Plot," the substance of these
lectures and addresses being given in the book,
"German Atrocities," heretofore published.
These articles are illustrative of and supplementary
to the principles stated in that volume.</p>

<p>While consenting to publication, the author
was not afforded opportunity for full revision of
this second volume, being again called over-seas
just as this book was being put into type. This
will account for the form in which the material
appears.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="lu">THE<br />
ARCH-CRIMINAL</h2>

<h2>I</h2>


<h3>1. The Kaiser's Hatred of the United
States</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> is a proverb that things done in secret
soon or late are published from the housetops.</p>

<p>Certainly everything that was hidden as
to the plots of the Potsdam gang is, little by
little, now being revealed.</p>

<p>Nothing illustrates this fact better than
that volume published in Leipsic in 1907,
called "Reminiscences of Ten Years in the
German Embassy in Washington, D. C."</p>

<p>When that aged diplomat published the
story of his diplomatic career he doubtless
thought that the volume prepared for his
children and grandchildren and friends was
forever buried in the German language. It
never even occurred to the Councillor of the
Ambassador, von Holleben, that the book
would ever fall into the hands of any American.
The very fact that an American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
author found the volume in a second-hand
bookstore of Vienna in 1914 and translated
the three chapters on the Kaiser's representatives
in the United States and the organization
of the German-American League, must
have roused the Foreign Department in
Berlin to the highest point of anger.</p>

<p>Children and diplomats oftentimes unconsciously
betray the most important secrets.
No volume ever published could possibly
have revealed matters of greater moment to
Germany than this volume of reminiscences
that sets forth the propaganda carried on in
the United States by Ambassador von Holleben
and his legal councillor for the furthering
of the Pan-German Empire scheme.</p>

<p>No scholar can doubt the right of this old
diplomat to speak. The Kaiser personally
vouched for him by giving him this important
duty. The honours bestowed at the end
of his long diplomatic career tell their own
story. Every page breathes sincerity and
truthfulness. No one who reads this volume
can doubt that this author gave the exact
facts&mdash;facts well known to his German
friends&mdash;in the recollections of his diplomatic
career.</p>

<p>This diplomat tells us plainly that von<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Holleben and himself were sent to the
United States specially charged with the
task of reuniting Germans who were naturalized
in America with the German Empire.</p>

<p>It was their duty to organize secret German-American
societies in every great city
like New York and Brooklyn, Chicago and
Milwaukee, Cincinnati and St. Louis, and to
present to these societies a German flag sent
from the hands of the Kaiser himself.</p>

<p>Their work, says the author, was based
upon the fact that the Kaiser had passed a
law restoring full citizenship in Germany to
those Germans who had become naturalized
citizens of the United States. When, therefore,
these members of the German-American
League formally accepted their restored
citizenship their first duty was to the Fatherland
and the Kaiser and their second duty
to the United States and its Government.
Indeed, this lawyer and author actually goes
so far as to give extracts from von Holleben's
speech before the German-American
League in Chicago when he presented the
society with a German flag and swore the
members to the old-time allegiance.</p>

<p>He says that in some way the editor of
the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> found out about this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
meeting and wrote a very severe editorial,
after which, he adds, that von Holleben and
himself had to be more careful.</p>

<p>Concerning the Milwaukee meeting, he refers
to a conversation which revealed his
judgment that if ever there was trouble between
Germany and the United States the
war would partake of the nature of a civil
war. The author not only gives an account of
the conference held at the Waldorf-Astoria between
Ambassador von Holleben, Professors
Munsterberg of Harvard and Schoenfield of
Columbia and himself, on the one side, and
Herman Ridder on the other, but he gives
the instructions from Berlin that Herr
Ridder could only keep his subsidy from the
German Government for the New Yorker
<i>Staats Zeitung</i> by placing his fealty to Germany
first and subordinating his Americanism,
and that otherwise Ambassador von
Holleben would found a rival German paper
that would have back of it "unlimited resources,
to wit: the total resources of the
German Empire."</p>

<p>Here, then, is proof positive that the
Kaiser began his efforts to establish a pro-German
movement against the United
States for several years before 1906 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
that he methodically kept it up until the war
began.</p>

<p>Through it all he claimed to be our sincere
friend; but he was then, as he is to-day, an
implacable and relentless enemy, with a
heart laden with hatred and bitterness.</p>


<h3>2. The Kaiser's Character Revealed in
His Choosing the Sultan for His
Friend</h3>

<p>Nothing tests manhood like the choice of
a bosom-friend. Criminals choose bad associates.</p>

<p>Every Black Hand leader goes naturally
towards the saloon, the gambling house and
the dens where thieves congregate. Dickens
made Fagin surround himself with pickpockets,
burglars and murderers.</p>

<p>History tells us that Christianity has always
kept good company. Its friends have
been architects, artists, poets and statesmen.
Christianity repeats itself through its friends
in the Gothic Cathedral shaped in the form
of the cross, in the Transfiguration of
Raphael, the Duomo of Giotto, the Paradise
Lost of Milton, the In Memoriam of Tennyson,
the Emancipation Proclamation of Lincoln.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Christianity has never formed any
close friendships with jails, gallows or slave
ships. Men like Gladstone and Lincoln always
kept good company; their friends have
been scholars and heroes; but, in striking
contrast, consider the friends selected by the
Kaiser.</p>

<p>To the Kaiser came a critical hour; at
that moment he was at the parting of the
ways. It became necessary for him to make
a choice of friends. Like every man, his isolation
was impossible and friendship became
a necessity.</p>

<p>The Kaiser had the whole world from
which to choose. Yonder in London were
King Edward and his son, the Prince of
Wales. In France were certain statesmen
and scientists like Curie. There was the old
hero living in the capital of Japan and two
ex-Presidents known the world around for
their splendid manhood; and he could have
made overtures of friendship to any one of
these brave men; but in the silence of the
night the Kaiser passed in review earth's
great men, and finally selected for his close
friend the lowest of the low&mdash;the butcher,
unspeakable butcher&mdash;the Sultan of Turkey.</p>

<p>At that time the Sultan had just completed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the butchery of many Armenians.
His garments were red with blood, his hands
dripped with gore. His house was a harem;
his hand held a dagger. The sea-wall behind
his palace rose out of the blue waters
of the Bosporus.</p>

<p>When an American battle-ship was anchored
there and a diver went down he
pulled a rope and was brought up, shivering
with terror, and saying that he found
himself surrounded with corpses tied in
sacks and held down by stones at the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>In that hour the Kaiser exclaimed: "Let
the Sultan be my associate! I will go to
Constantinople and sign a treaty with the
unspeakable butcher."</p>

<p>And so the Kaiser took his train, lived in
the Sultan's palace, signed this treaty, and
hired the Sultan's knife and club, just as the
Chief Priest Annas chose Judas to be his
representative upon whom he could load the
responsibility for the murder of Jesus.</p>

<p>Never was a friendship more damnable.
Reared in a country that believed in the
sanctity of the marriage relation and in
monogamy, the Kaiser lined up with polygamy.
The treaty that he made was thoroughgoing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
He sent out word to all Mohammedans,
whether they lived in India or
Persia, in Arabia or Turkey, that they must
remember that the Kaiser had entered into a
treaty to become their protector and friend.
Having become a Lutheran in Berlin, he
became a Mohammedan in Constantinople
on the principle that "When you are in
Rome do as the Romans do, and when you
are in hell act like the devil"&mdash;a simple
principle which the Kaiser proceeded to obey
as soon as he reached Constantinople.</p>

<p>Every one knew that the Kaiser wanted
to build a German railroad through to Bagdad
and the Persian Gulf; this would give
him an outlet for surplus goods to be sold in
India. Serbia lay straight across the path,
and he had to work out some scheme to
attack Serbia. Then he needed the Sultan's
friendship, and the end justified the means&mdash;and
the end was the Bagdad Railroad.</p>

<p>But the Turk tired of being the Kaiser's
tool; he wanted more land; the Armenian
was in his way; the Turk was lazy, shiftless
and a spendthrift. The Armenian was industrious
and hard-working. The Turk's
method of living made him poor. The gifts
of the Armenian tended towards wealth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Once in twenty years the Turk found himself
a pauper and found the Armenian rich;
the result was envy and covetousness on the
part of the Sultan and his people. It became
necessary to bribe the Turk to stand
by the Kaiser and his Baghdad Railroad.
The Kaiser's German officers, therefore, furnished
the bribe.</p>

<p>"Let us go to this Armenian village, or
that, and kill the people. We German officers
will take the large houses of the rich
merchants and move into them, and your
Turkish soldiers can kill the old men, use the
Armenian girls for the harem, and fling the
little children's bodies into pits dug in the
garden behind the house. We will enter
the village in the morning as soldiers; when
the night comes, as Germans and Turks, we
will be the only people living in the Armenian
village, and we will move into their
stores and take possession of their houses
and their looms."</p>

<p>"You cannot hang an entire nation," said
Edmund Burke. "You must arrest the
leaders and hang them." Burke was right
as to the punishment of criminals, but he
was wrong when it comes to murdering industrious
and honest Armenians. You can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
murder an entire nation, for the Germans
and the Turks have practically done it.
Ambassador Morgenthau has just said that
the Kaiser and the Sultan through their
forces have murdered nearly a million Armenians.
But, soon or late, remorse and
conscience will take hold upon these two unspeakable
butchers with hands that drip with
blood&mdash;the butcher Kaiser, the butcher Sultan,
that represent earth's two murderous
twins.</p>


<h3>3. Pershing's Charges versus the Kaiser</h3>

<p>Nothing measures a man so accurately as
the names he gives to his favourite son.
Most significant, therefore, is the fact that
the Kaiser named his second son Eitel,
or Attila. Who was this Attila who has
captured the imagination of the Kaiser?
He was a Hun who devastated Italy fifteen
hundred years ago. The motto of
this black-hearted murderer Attila the Hun
was: "Where my feet fall, let grass not
grow for a hundred years." When the
Kaiser read Attila's story he exclaimed:
"That is the man for me!" First, he named
his favourite son for Attila the Hun. Second,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in sending his German soldiers out to
China, and later in 1914 to Belgium, he gave
them this charge: "You will take no prisoners;
you will show no mercy; you will
give no quarter; you will make yourselves as
terrible as the Huns under Attila." Plainly
the Kaiser knew his men. He knew that
they were capable of outdoing even that
monster Attila the Hun. So he sent them
forth to bayonet babes, violate old women,
murder old men, crucify officers, violate nuns,
sink <i>Lusitanias</i>, and turn solemn treaties into
scraps of paper.</p>

<p>Now over against the Kaiser's charge,
black as hell, and big with death, witness
Pershing's charge, reported loosely by a
French boy, with his imperfect knowledge
of English, translated out of the French
newspapers on July 18, 1917. Pershing's
brief address comes to this:</p>

<p>"Young soldiers of America, you are here
in France to help expel an invading enemy;
but you are also here to lift a shield above
the poor and weak; you will safeguard all
property; you will lift a shield above the
aged and oppressed; you will be most courteous
to women, gentle and kind to little
children; guard against temptation of every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
kind; fear God, fight bravely, defend Liberty,
honour your native land. God have
you in His keeping." "Pershing."</p>

<p>The difference between yonder lowest hell
in its uttermost abyss and yonder highest
heaven, where standeth the throne of a just
God, is not greater than the chasm that separates
that unspeakable butcher, the Kaiser,
from General Pershing and the American
soldier boys, who have never betrayed in
France, the noblest ideals of service cherished
by the people of the American Republic.</p>


<h3>4. Who Taught the Kaiser That a
Treaty Is a Scrap of Paper?</h3>

<p>Each month of this war clears away
some clouds and reveals Germany as wholly
given over to crime and treachery. At
the beginning of the invasion of Belgium,
the Kaiser spoke of his treaty safeguarding
the neutrality of that little land as a "scrap
of paper." At the moment no one seems to
have realized whence the Kaiser had that
cynical expression. Now the whole damnable
story has been made clear. Twenty-five
years ago the Kaiser, in one of his
addresses, used these words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"From my childhood I have been under
the influence of five men&mdash;Alexander, Julius
C&aelig;sar, Theodoric II, Napoleon and Frederick
the Great. These five men dreamed
their dream of a world empire; they failed.
I am dreaming my dream of a world empire,
but I shall succeed."</p>

<p>Now why did the Kaiser over and over
again proclaim his allegiance to Frederick
the Great? How is it that he celebrates his
ancestor, Frederick? This "scrap of paper"
incident makes it all quite clear. The bitter
waters gushing out of the Potsdam Palace
go back to a bitter spring named Frederick
the Great. The poisoned fruit that ripened
in 1914 hangs on a bough whose trunk was
planted by Frederick in far-off days.</p>

<p>Among many musty old German books
recently published is a little book by that
same Frederick. The Prussian king was
writing certain notes for the guidance of his
sons and successors, among whom is the
present Kaiser. In his page of counsels
Frederick talks very plainly about the
breaking of treaties:</p>

<p>"Consider a treaty as a scrap of paper
under any one of the following emergencies:
First, when necessity compels it. Second,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
when you lack means to continue the war.
Third, when you cannot by any other means
combat your ally or enemy."</p>

<p>Then Frederick raises one question: "If
the interests of your army or your people or
yourself are at stake or you have to keep
your word on one hand and your pledge
word and treaty is on the other hand, which
path will you take? Who can be stupid
enough to hesitate in answering this question?
In other words, treaties are to be
kept when they promote your interest, and
shamelessly broken when you gain thereby."</p>

<p>The Kaiser, therefore, had from Frederick,
his ancestor, this handbook on lying. In
turn, the Kaiser gave this notion of the
treaty as a scrap of paper to his Chancellor,
Bethmann-Hollweg, who engraved, as
has been said, "on eternal brass the infamy
of Germany": "We are now in a
state of necessity, and necessity knows no
law. We were compelled to override the
the just protest of Luxembourg and Belgian
Governments. The wrong&mdash;I speak openly&mdash;that
we are committing we will endeavour
to make good as soon as our military goal
has been reached. Anybody who is threatened,
as we are threatened, and who is fighting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
for his highest possessions, can have only
one thought, how he is to hack his way
through."</p>

<p>Guizot mentions "honour and fidelity to
the pledged word" as one of the distinguishing
elements of what is called "a civilized
State." But this puts Germany among the
barbarous savages. Three indictments and
convictions have blackened the name of
Germany throughout all the world. First,
her atrocious and dishonourable methods of
warfare; second, the carrying off into
slavery of non-combatants, the Belgians and
French, and third, the breach of the pledged
word and the solemn treaties with other
nations.</p>

<p>But at last we know that Frederick the
Great, the ancestor of the Kaiser, was the
author of the phrase, "the treaty is a scrap
of paper." What was once in the gristle in
the ancestor is now bred in the bone of the
Kaiser and Crown Prince. That phrase, "a
scrap of paper," holds the germ of a thousand
wars. It spells the ruin of civilization. Not
to resent it by war, is for the Allies to commit
spiritual suicide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h3>5. The Plot of the Kaiser</h3>

<p>All the pamphlets issued secretly to the
members of the Pan-German League invariably
used Rome as their illustration.
We are not surprised, therefore, to find that
the German leaders called attention to
the fact that it took two wars at intervals
of some years to make Rome a world
empire.</p>

<p>In like manner, therefore, the Kaiser and
his Cabinet told the German people at home
and abroad that the first war, beginning in
1914, would establish a Middle-Europe Empire
extending from Hamburg on the North
Sea to Bagdad on the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>One of the pamphlets issued many years
ago fixed the countries to be conquered about
1915, and distinctly mentioned Denmark,
Holland, Belgium and North France, Poland
and Rumania, Hungary and Austria, Serbia
and Bulgaria, and the wheat granaries of
Russia, with Turkey and Armenia.</p>

<p>The number of people to be conquered and
included after the first war was fixed at
250,000,000.</p>

<p>The argument states that it will take but
a few years to compact this Middle-Europe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Empire and that naturally Great Britain,
Spain and Italy, to the west, with Norway
and Sweden to the north, with Italy and
Switzerland to the south, and of course
Greece and Egypt would, from time to time,
as crises came, fall inevitably into Germany's
hand. Berlin, as the world capital, should
by 1920 be the magnet, and the little particles
of iron, named the Balkan States, would
be drawn and held by this great German
magnet in Berlin.</p>

<p>The first step to be taken and the first
goal to be reached concerned, of course, the
English Channel, the Dutch cities on the
mouth of the Rhine, and the iron mines of
Northern France. We know to an absolute
certainty all the details of this plan.</p>

<p>For more than thirty years Germany had
been organizing her army; she knew every
road, inn, bridge, factory, shop, and wholesale
store in Denmark and Holland, Belgium
and France. In all of the larger ones she
had German agents belonging to the Pan-German
League toiling as workmen and
every detail was planned out in advance.</p>

<p>In 1910 General von Bissing, one of the
Kaiser's closest friends, was sent to Brussels.
For years he spent the summer months apparently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
at the watering places near The
Hague in Holland and Ostend in Belgium,
preparatory to the hour when Germany
would seize Belgium and he assume his position
as Governor-General, living in Brussels.</p>

<p>Men nearing death tell the truth. In January
of 1917 von Bissing prepared a memorandum
for the direction of Belgian affairs
in His Majesty's name and according to his
wish. This document contains the meditations
of a dying man. The statements he
makes, he says, contain the views that inspired
his every act in Belgium during his
administration.</p>

<p>In his last will and testament von Bissing,
in the spring of 1917, advises the German
Government in Berlin that the time has come
to throw off all disguises. He says that at
the beginning of the war it was probably
good policy to deny that the Government
ever intended to annex Belgium, but, he says,
"now that we are victorious there is no
reason why we should not publish to the
world the fact that we never intend to give
up one foot of the Belgian sea-coast, nor one
ton of the Belgian coal, nor one acre of the
French iron mines."</p>

<p>He says plainly: "The annual Belgian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
production of 23,000,000 tons of coal has
given us a monopoly on the continent which
has helped to maintain our vitality. If we
do not hold Belgium, administer Belgium in
future for our interest and protect Belgium
by force of arms, our trade and industry will
lose the positions they have won in Belgium
and perhaps will never recover them."</p>

<p>And what about Dutch cities and seaports?
On page eighteen of General von
Bissing's last will and testament he adds:</p>

<p>"Our frontier, in the interest of our sea
power, must be pushed forward to the sea."
This sentence makes it perfectly plain that a
little later Germany intends to incorporate
Rotterdam in her own customs union.
"Belgium must be seized and held, as it now
is, and as it is to-day it must be in the future.
The conquest of Belgium has simply been
forced upon us by the necessities of German
expansion."</p>

<p>Von Bissing, however, recognizes the difficulty
of annexing Belgium and securing the
consent of the members who shall arrange
the treaty of peace at the conclusion of the
war, and this is his decision:</p>

<p>"Our best method, therefore, is to avoid,
during the peace negotiations, all discussion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
about the form of the annexation and to apply
nothing but the right of conquest.
Plainly Belgium's King can never consent to
abandon his sovereignty, but we can read in
Machiavelli that he who desires to take possession
of a country will be compelled to remove
the King or regent, even by killing
him."</p>

<p>Von Bissing has torn off all masks. He
himself states that he is speaking for the
Kaiser, as his most trusted friend and counsellor.
Germany intends, therefore, ultimately
to kill King Albert of Belgium, and
this carries with it that the Kaiser and his
War Staff believe they have the right to kill
any King or President who happens to stand
in the pathway of their ambition. Every
lover of mankind whose heart is knitted in
with the poor and the weak will understand
what that editor meant the other day when
he said:</p>

<p>"The one duty of the hour, therefore, for
America, is to kill Germans, that we may
keep the rest of the world from being
killed."</p>

<h2 class="lu">THE JUDAS<br />
AMONG NATIONS</h2>

<h2>II</h2>


<h3>1. The Original Plot of the Members
of the Potsdam Gang</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Many</span> historic meetings, big with social
disaster, are recorded in history. Witness
the meeting of the Athenian judges for
the killing of Socrates. Witness the coming
together of the priests and Judas for the
piteous tragedy of the death of Jesus. Witness
that midnight meeting of the conspirators
in Florence for the burning of Savonarola.
Terrible also the results of that
meeting in the Potsdam Palace in 1896 that
culminated in the Pan-German Empire
scheme.</p>

<p>What began as a spark that day has ended
in a world conflagration.</p>

<p>In retrospect the Kaiser and his associates
had many events behind them to encourage
the ambition to make Berlin a world capital,
Kaiser Wilhelm the world emperor and all
the other nations and races subject peoples.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Beginning in 1860 with thirty-five millions
of people and only fifteen billions of dollars,
Germany had climbed to greatness upon iron
steps, heated hot by war. Never did wars
yield so large a return.</p>

<p>The war with Denmark had given Germany
the Kiel Harbour, the Kiel Canal and
a sea-coast for her ships.</p>

<p>The war with Austria had given Germany
the rich coal provinces of Central Europe.
The war with France had given Germany
the iron mines of Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p>And here for the next war were Denmark
and Holland, Belgium and northern France&mdash;so
many jewel boxes that could be looted.
To the eastward were Poland with her coal
mines, Rumania with her oil fields and Russia
with her wheat granaries. And once Central
Europe became a Middle-Europe German
Empire there was no reason why later on
Germany should not extend her conquests to
Russia on the east and England on the west,
and then to North and South America.</p>

<p>It was a great scheme. Never was prize
so rich. Never could obstacles be so easily
swept away. To make Berlin a world-capital
and Kaiser Wilhelm a world-emperor
only two things were needed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Plainly the first thing to be done was to
organize the Pan-German Empire League
and educate the leading men of Germany&mdash;the
ship owners, bankers, merchants and
manufacturers, editors, ministers, priests and
university professors.</p>

<p>Local branch societies were organized in
all the large German towns and cities.
Weekly meetings were held, papers read and
reports made. Slowly people of the middle
class were included in the league. Documents
marked "Secret and Confidential"
were distributed, setting forth the details of
the scheme.</p>

<p>Full reports were made as to what Germany
could make by seizing the fields of
Denmark, the cities on the mouth of the
Rhine in Belgium, the coal and iron mines
of France, Poland and Russia, and also the
undeveloped resources of the Valley of the
Euphrates.</p>

<p>Careful statements were prepared as to
the difficulties that must be surmounted, but
always this lure was held out&mdash;that the
poorest German who then had nothing,
would when Germany was victorious become
a landowner, live in a mansion and drive
his own automobile. Then he would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Russians and Frenchmen to wait upon him,
since the German was a superman, intended
for a patrician, while all other races were
pigs, intended by nature to be bondsmen and
plebeians.</p>

<p>"The rest of the world is amassing wealth,
and when the fruit is ripe then we Germans
will pluck it"&mdash;this was their motto.</p>

<p>Little by little the germ of world-ambition
became a fever, burning in the soul of every
German at home or abroad. It took twenty
years to thoroughly inculcate every individual
of the German race with this feverish
ambition, but when 1914 came every German
had gone over to the Pan-German
scheme and was ready to die for it.</p>


<h3>2. The Berlin Schemers and Their Plot</h3>

<p>After all the Germans at home and abroad
understood the Pan-German scheme of seditious
intrigue in foreign countries and the
vast web was spun and thrown out over all
the cities and continents where the Kaiser's
representatives were living, the second thing
to be done was to make the plan clear by
spreading it out like a great map. The
method used, therefore, was pictorial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The Department of Publicity in Berlin
became experts on geography. They began
to issue illustrated maps so that the rudest
German peasants and the German colonists
living in Milwaukee or El Paso, in Rio Janeiro
or Buenos Aires, in Brussels or St. Petersburg,
in Melbourne or Calcutta, could easily
understand the method and the goal.</p>

<p>Out of twenty maps issued in Berlin and
reproduced by Andre Cheredame, no one is
more important than the one marked "The
Old Roman Empire." The simplest German
miner understood the map at a glance
and realized its meaning for the members
of the Pan-German League. Here is old
Rome marked world capital. Here is C&aelig;sar
Augustus called the first world emperor.
Here is Carthage with its capital looted and
Roman peasants remaining after the victory
to move into rich men's houses and estates
of North Africa. And here also were the
maps of conquered Palestine, Ephesus, Athens
and Corinth. To be sure the old Romans
had to become soldiers, but, later, did not
each Roman soldier live in the rich gardens
around Thebes, Ephesus and Corinth?</p>

<p>Instantly the imaginations of the German
peasants and workmen kindled. The Kaiser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was right. What had been in Rome must
be in Berlin. The Elbe must succeed the
Tiber. Berlin shall be the second world-capital.
Our Wilhelm shall be the second
world-emperor. Germania shall be written
straight across Europe from Hamburg on
the North Sea to Bagdad on the Persian
Gulf. Germans alone shall be allowed to
carry weapons, as once only the Roman was
allowed to own a spear; only Germans shall
be allowed to hold title deeds to lands, even
as once only Romans could hold a field or
a house in fee simple. Old Rome won by
becoming a military State.</p>

<p>Did not the people of Rome go forth as
soldiers and return with triumphal processions,
with treasures of loot that took days
to pass along the Appian Way, while the
Romans stood cheering and the women and
children sang and threw flowers in the path?
Why should not the German army, between
the reaping of the wheat in July and the
threshing of the wheat in October, return
from Brussels and Paris laden with treasure,
while a second triumphal procession marched
down Wilhelmstrasse?</p>

<p>The German peasants kindled at this
dream. Why should the German have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
live always on bologna sausage, drink beer,
eat sauerkraut and live in ugly houses when
the people of Paris and London drank champagne,
ate roast fowl, wore French laces and
the finest English wools? It was a wicked
shame. Surely the German was intended
for something better than sauerkraut and
beer!</p>

<p>"Two weeks and we will be in Brussels.
Three weeks and we will have Paris. Two
months and we will loot London."</p>

<p>This was the plan. How significant that
letter, taken from the dead body of a German
boy found in No Man's Land, near
Compi&egrave;gne.</p>

<p>"Within three days, Liebschen, we will
be in Paris. I intend to bring you a pocketful
of Paris rings and jewels, with Paris
gowns and laces."</p>

<p>From the body of a German boy found
near Lun&eacute;ville was taken this letter saying
that, with his three companions, he had
picked out four French farms and left the
houses standing, and that his friends and
himself had picked out these farms as permanent
homes. Later he added that Heinrich
thought it would be much better for
them to wait until they smashed England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and made Canada a German colony. Then
they could own, not small French farms, but
vast Canadian farms with a hundred tenants
working for him in the valleys around Toronto
and the vineyards of Winnipeg and
orchards of Hudson Bay.</p>

<p>Most shrewd and cunning, the plotters of
the Potsdam gang. They knew how to feed
the fires of envy and avarice in the German
people. Every few weeks they placed new
material in the hands of every German at
home and abroad. They reminded each poor
peasant and foreign colonist that he was a
superman, and that by day and by night he
was to prepare for the time when he would
become the head of all the people of the
town or industry with which he was related.
Poor Germans in foreign countries dreamed
their dreams of the time when they would
be appointed by the Kaiser and Foreign Minister
to take charge of the village in Mexico,
the mine in Chile, or when they would be the
tax collector in some distant province.</p>

<p>We know now, from letters that have
been found, that the German soldiers in
France carried in their pockets a description
by the German historian Curtius of the triumphal
procession along the Appian Way,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
when the Roman conquerors came home
loaded with loot. These skillful German
plotters printed at the bottom of Curtius's
description the statement that each German
soldier must look forward to a similar return
from London, Paris and Brussels to march
through the streets of Munich and Berlin.</p>

<p>What a dream was this German dream!
What treasures were to be brought into
Berlin! What marbles and bronzes of Rodin
stolen from Paris! At last Berlin was to
own beautiful paintings, for the treasures of
the Louvre were to be the Kaiser's.</p>

<p>Never was there such a dream dreamed
by peasants who soon were to become princes
and kings and patricians. The German had
exchanged the rye bread of 1913 for the
"fog bank" of 1918; had given up German
beer to grasp only empty, breaking bubbles.
But it was a great dream while it lasted. In
pursuance of his hope he sacrificed three
million German boys, left dead in the fields
of Flanders and France. He sent home four
million German cripples. He filled the land
with vast armies of widows and orphans.</p>

<p>It could not have been otherwise. There
has never been, and never will be, but one
world city&mdash;Rome; and there has never been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
but one world-emperor&mdash;C&aelig;sar Augustus.
There is to be one universal kingdom&mdash;and
that is the kingdom of God, the kingdom of
love, justice, peace and good-will. The German
has been pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

<p>A world-kingdom will come, but no Kaiser
will rule over that empire of love. In that
world-parliament all the races shall be represented
as equals; then the earth that has
long been a battle-field shall become an Eden
garden, where all are patriots towards the
world-kingdom, and scholars towards the intellect,
and self-sufficing towards the family,
and obedient towards their God.</p>


<h3>3. German Superiority a Myth That
Has Exploded</h3>

<p>Several years before the great war began
a Dutch humorist wrote a play on German
megalomania. He portrayed a German
schoolroom in Prussia. Thirty or forty
embryonic Prussians are at the desks and a
Prussian schoolmaster is in the chair.</p>

<p>"Children, what is the greatest country in
the world?"</p>

<p>All shouted vociferously, "Germany!"</p>

<p>"What is the greatest city in the world?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Berlin!"</p>

<p>"Who is the greatest man in the world?"</p>

<p>"The Kaiser!"</p>

<p>"Should there ever be, children, a vacancy
in the Trinity, who is best fitted to fill the
position?"</p>

<p>"The Crown Prince!"</p>

<p>"Who are the chosen people of the good
old German God?"</p>

<p>"The German people!"</p>

<p>Never was there a finer bit of sarcasm
and yet the Germans were never able to understand
the play. The Kaiser, the War
Staff, the Cabinet, down to the last wretched
creature working in the stables and the
sewers, reading the play, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What is the man driving at? Why, of
course the Germans are the greatest people
in the world&mdash;we admit it!"</p>

<p>Now, during the last few years the Germans
have spent untold millions in propagating
this myth of superiority, and yet the German
intellect has never even had a second-rate
position. Call the roll of all the tools
that have redeemed men from drudgery and
you will find that Germany's contributions
are hopelessly inferior to the other nations.</p>

<p>The new industrial era began with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
locomotive and steamship; James Watt invented
the one and Stevenson the other.</p>

<p>The new era of physical comfort began
with the loom; a Frenchman named Jacquard
and an Englishman named Arkwright
made men warm for their work in winter.
Garments within the reach of the poor man
in forest and factory, field and mine, means
the cotton gin, and that gin is the gift of
an American. The sewing machine changed
woman's position, but the world owes that to
our own Elias Howe.</p>

<p>We owe the telegraph to an English inventor
and, in part, to Morse. We owe the
cable in part to Lord Kelvin and, in part, to
Cyrus Field. We owe the telephone to Bell
and the wireless to Marconi.</p>

<p>Holland invented the submarine, Wright
the airplane, McCormick the reaper and
Edison the phonograph.</p>

<p>An American invented the German submarine;
an American invented the German
torpedo; an American invented the German
machine-gun; an American invented the
Murphy button, the yellow fever antitoxin,
the Dakin solution.</p>

<p>An English physician discovered the circulation
of the blood, Jenner gave us vaccination,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Lister antiseptics, France the Pasteur
serums and the Curie radio discoveries, while
a Bulgarian, Dr. Metchnikoff, discovered the
enemies of the blood.</p>

<p>It was from France, England and the
United States that Germany stole the typewriter,
the steel building, the use of rubber,
the aniline dyes, re&euml;nforced concrete bridges,
air-brakes, the use of electricity.</p>

<p>One of the most amazing volumes in the
world is the "History of Tools and Machinery."
We have all known for a long time
that there is not one single German name
among the eight great masters of painting
that begins with Rembrandt and includes
men like Velasquez and Giotto. We have
long known that there is no German sculptor
of the first class nor a German sculptor that
is within ten thousand leagues of Rodin,
Michael Angelo or Phidias. We have long
known that Schubert and Schumann and
Rubinstein and Haydn and Chopin were all
Jews, and that three-fourths of the other so-called
German musicians were Jews whose
ancestors suffered such frightful political
disabilities in Germany and were so regularly
looted of all their property that they
gave up their Hebrew names and took German,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
just as now thousands upon thousands
of Germans in this country, ashamed of their
names, are Americanizing their family title.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that if a Jew will only
write the creative music, like that of Beethoven,
a German whose gift is detail will
conduct the orchestra.</p>

<p>The German can standardize a machine,
providing an Englishman, a Frenchman or
an American will first invent it. The German
will gather up the remnants and scraps
and odds and ends in a clothing factory&mdash;but,
oh, think of an American gentleman
having to wear the coat that was cut by a
tailor in Berlin or Munich! Having during
ten different summers looked at their garments,
all one can say is that the German
men and women are covered up but not
clothed.</p>

<p>For thirty years the Germans have paid
their representatives to stand on the corner
of the street and bawl out to every passer-by:
"Great is the Kaiser! Great are we
Germans! Let all people with cymbals,
sackbut, shawms and psaltery cry aloud, saying
'Great is the Kaiser and all his people!'"</p>

<p>And now suddenly the myth has burst like
a bubble. The delusion is exploded. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Kaiser has found out that it is dangerous to
blow too much hot air into a German bladder.</p>

<p>Measured around the stomach in the Hofbraus
in the presence of a barrel of beer, the
Prussian and the Bavarian are great; but
the hat band requires the least material of
any made in four countries.</p>

<p>For the time has come to confess this simple
fact that for any one great tool, or art,
or contribution to science created by a German
there are four invented by either an
American, an Englishman or a Frenchman.</p>


<h3>4. German Intrigues</h3>

<p>The spider's web stretched out over a
flower bed with a great fat spider at the
centre and the threads along which the
spider runs to thrust its poisoned sting into
the enmeshed butterfly is nature's most
accurate symbol of the vast web of espionage
lying over North and South America with
secret threads that vibrated to the touch of
the spider at the centre named Berlin.</p>

<p>In that web thousands of German-Americans
were enmeshed. The records of our
Secret Service concerning these German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
enemies of the American Government read
like a book of assassinations or like a history
of the black arts. When the whole story
comes to be told it will horrify the world.</p>

<p>The quality of the German-Americans that
Berlin bribed is set forth in the reminiscences
of Witte when he says that the Kaiser and
the Foreign Department paid Munsterberg
of Harvard University $5,000 a year salary
and that Munsterberg was the most successful
and efficient spy that the German system
had ever developed.</p>

<p>In the long list of German agents are to
be found the names of German-American
bankers who received secret decorations and
medals from the German Government; of
German merchants who were partners in this
country of firms in the Fatherland and were
bribed by a ribbon and an invitation to the
Potsdam Palace; of German newspaper men
who were under German pay, and, most
amazing of all, among the papers seized in
the office of a German Consul was found a
commission appointing this Consul in an
American city to the office of Governor-General
of one of the greatest States of
Canada as soon as Canada became a German
colony.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the threads from Berlin ran into
the various cities of Mexico. A German
head office was set up under the general
direction of Zimmermann in Berlin and of
von Bernstorff in Washington. Certain
large institutions that did business in Mexico,
working in the same field, were quietly
elbowed out of Mexico, and an American
company, ostensibly American, but controlled
by Germans, took over the business
of the other firms under special arrangement
with Mexico. Pledges were given Mexico
that as soon as Germany had reduced Canada
and the United States to the position of
German colonies, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona,
Nevada and California should be
handed back to the Mexicans.</p>

<p>Millions were spent by the German Foreign
Office as ordinary men spend dollars. The
German spies, like Boy-Ed and von Papen,
arranged to blow up American munition
factories and held dinners waiting for a
telephone message saying that the magazine
had just exploded or the depot had taken
fire or a scow had been sunk, after which
they drank the health of the man who
lighted the match.</p>

<p>German agents burned up wheat elevators<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
with hundreds of millions of dollars' worth
of wheat; they fired warehouses, blew up
bridges, wrecked munition plants, destroyed
shiploads of food, dynamited the House of
Parliament in Ottawa, sank the <i>Lusitania</i>
near Ireland, spread glanders among the
horses in Sweden, poisoned the food in
Rumania, sank the ships of Norway, plotted
against the Argentine Republic. Their
spies, dynamiters, secret agents, were in
every capital and country because it was
their purpose to make Berlin a world capital,
Kaiser Wilhelm the world emperor and to
Germanize the people of the whole earth.</p>

<p>The web had as its centre the Potsdam
Palace, but its black lines ran out into all
the earth.</p>


<h3>5. German Burglars Loaded With Loot
Are the More Easily Captured</h3>

<p>It seems that Germany has published, for
the Spaniards, a list of treasures she has won.
In the long calendar the reader finds that
eight States&mdash;Belgium, France, Poland, Rumania,
Russia, Serbia, Armenia, Italy&mdash;have
all been looted.</p>

<p>The Germans claim they have spoiled over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
three hundred first class cities, several thousand
secondary cities and towns; they add
that they have destroyed seventy-three
cathedrals and looted them of their priceless
treasures of statues, paintings, stained glass,
vessels of silver and gold.</p>

<p>With brazen audacity the German pamphlet
tells the Spaniards that they have seized
so many hundred thousand watches, so many
hundred thousand rings, so much treasure of
diamonds and jewels, so many paintings
from rich men's houses, and the long boast
ends with the statement that they "obtained
nearly five billions of loot out of western
Russia and have assessed two billions more
upon the farmers, villages and cities of
Ukraine."</p>

<p>But the boast is an idle and empty boast.
It is true that no army of the Allies has
crossed the German frontier to permanently
hold a city. But let no man think that Germany
has succeeded because of the richness
of her loot. There is a success that is failure.
There is a victory that is defeat.</p>

<p>Macbeth killed Duncan and went to live
in the palace of the dead king, but did
Macbeth succeed? Was not his palace a
brief halting place in his journey towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
remorse, insanity and the day when Duncan's
friends in turn slew Macbeth?</p>

<p>The rich judges of Athens succeeded and
Socrates failed. They went home to drink
wine and feast, while Socrates went to the
jail to drink a cup of poison. But who
succeeded? The judges whose names are
written low down and bespattered with
dirt&mdash;or Socrates, whose name fills the sky
and who has become the thinker for the
world?</p>

<p>What if the Kaiser does boast of his
successes to-day? So boasted Nero&mdash;sending
Paul to his rags, crusts and the dungeon
preparatory to the headman's axe. But it is
Nero that lost out, and it is Paul who reigns
a crowned king.</p>

<p>The chief priests celebrated their victory;
at the close of the day, after they had succeeded
in crucifying Jesus; but after nineteen
centuries the murderers are unknown
and almost forgotten, while that young carpenter
rules over His Empire of Love.</p>

<p>To-day the Kaiser claims to have won the
victory of "a superman." In that he has
carried murder, arson, lying, rapine, lust up
to the <i>nth</i> power, let us concede his claim.
Not otherwise two hundred years ago the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Indian, with his scalping knife, his war-whoop
and his tomahawk, was "a superman" in
terms of savagery. Not otherwise the
Spaniards under Bloody Alva were "supermen"
in terms of rack, thumbscrew and instruments
of torture.</p>

<p>But what savages once did in the little,
the Kaiser and his men now do in the large.
But because the Kaiser can publish a long
list of wealth gained&mdash;by breaking his
treaties, by murder, arson and lust&mdash;let no
man think that he is successful.</p>

<p>The two Biddle brothers looted the Bank
of England, but they became outcasts upon
the face of the earth, and always the
dungeon yawned for them, just as the
Kaiser and von Hindenburg never sleep at
night without a vision of an oak tree, a long
bough and a hemp rope dangling at the end,
for the hemp is now twisted that will one
day choke to death the murderous Kaiser
and his War Staff.</p>

<p>Let no patriot, whether he lives in Spain,
Russia or the United States, forget that ours
is a world ruled by men who were defeated.</p>

<p>To-day on the thrones of the world are
the heroes, like Paul and Demosthenes; the
martyrs who were burned with Savonarola<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in Florence or poisoned with Socrates in
Athens.</p>

<p>To-day, the soldiers of Marathon and
Marston Moor, Gettysburg and the Marne
now rule the world.</p>

<p>The treasure of the burglar and the brigand
dissolves like snowflakes in a river.</p>

<p>Long ago the Hebrew poet said: "I have
seen the wicked flourish like a green bay
tree, and then I lifted up my eyes, and, behold!
he was not." And when a little time
has passed all lovers of liberty and humanity
will exclaim: "During four years I have
seen the Kaiser and von Hindenburg flourish
as the green bay tree, and I lifted up mine
eyes, and, behold! they were not. For the
breath of His nostrils had slain them."</p>


<h3>6. Germans Who Hide Behind the
Screen</h3>

<p>Two thousand years are a long time in
terms of history.</p>

<p>Many damnable tools have been invented
during these twenty centuries. The rack,
the thumbscrew, the tomahawk, the fagot
belong among these devilish instruments.</p>

<p>Cruelties so terrible have been devised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that old scholars often felt unwilling to believe
that men were so low in the scale as to
have been the authors of these methods of
fiendishness.</p>

<p>In the hope, therefore, of keeping respect
for man many scholars transferred all responsibility
unto devils. They called in
Satan and made him to be the father of hate
and cruelty. They could not believe that
Nero, Judas or Torquemada could conceive
such wickedness. They therefore made the
devil with his cloven feet and his long tail to
whisper these cunning suggestions in the ear
of the traitor. Thus the responsibility for
unwonted cruelty was divided between the
murderer and the devil who counselled the
black crime.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most damnable thing that was
ever suggested by the devil in two thousand
years is this little object called the German
soldier's token. Never did an object so small
send forth cruelties so large and manifold.</p>

<p>The little disc is stamped out on thick
paper for German privates and upon aluminum
for the officers. At the top of this
cardboard is the portrait of that awful being
called by the Kaiser "our good old German
God."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Look at his white hair, the long beard and
the great sword in the right hand, with the
suggestion that since God uses the sword the
German soldier must cut men to pieces also.</p>

<p>Beneath you see flames gushing up, suggesting
to the German soldier that he is
quite right in burning the houses of France
and Belgium after he has looted them, and
for flinging the dead bodies into the blazing
rafters. Now read the words written beneath
the face of the being the Germans call
God.</p>

<p>"Strike them all dead. The Day of
Judgment shall ask you no questions."</p>

<p>Strike dead old men and women! Dash
the children's brains out against the stone
wall! Violate young girls! Mutilate their
fair bodies so that they will be unseemly
when they are found by the husband or
father. Burn, steal, kill&mdash;but remember
that your Kaiser and the War Staff have
promised to stand between you and God
Almighty and the Day of Judgment! Even
if Jesus did say, "Woe unto them that
offend against my little ones," you must remember
that your Kaiser and officers have
promised you immunity on the Day of Judgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>That is what is meant by the sentence on
page thirty-one in the German handbook of
"War on Land": "That which is permissible
to the German soldier is anything whatsoever
that will help him gain his goal
quickly."</p>

<p>Nothing better illustrates the total collapse
of manhood in the Germans than this
soldier's token.</p>

<p>A coward by nature, the German is afraid
to kill and steal, and so he invented a screen
behind which he could hide and named it
"the soldier's token."</p>

<p>Going into a French village the Germans
collect the women and children, order them
to march in advance, shoot a few to terrorize
the rest, and then, hiding behind this living
screen, the Germans march forward. In
this way they protect themselves.</p>

<p>The whole history of the human race contains
no chapter of atrocity like the atrocity
of the Germans. The history of the world
contains no story of cowardice so black and
damnable as the cowardice of the Germans.
Out of cowardice the soldier's token was
born.</p>

<p>And so the Kaiser and the War Staff invented
this round piece of cardboard, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the representation of God as going forth
with His sword to kill men and with His
flames to burn them and with the motto:
"Strike them all dead, for the Day of
Judgment will ask you no questions."</p>

<p>Therefore among the instruments of
cruelty, called the rack, the fagot, the
thumbscrew and the tomahawk, let us give
the first place to the German soldier's token,
the most damnable weapon that has come
out of hell during the last two thousand
years.</p>


<h3>7. Must German Men Be Exterminated?</h3>

<p>A singular revulsion of sentiment as to
what must be done with the German army
after the war, is now sweeping over the civilized
world. Men who once were pacifists,
men of chivalry and kindness, men whose
life has been devoted to philanthropy and
reform, scholars and statesmen, whose very
atmosphere is compassion and magnanimity
towards the poor and weak, are now uttering
sentiments that four years ago would
have been astounding beyond compare.
These men feel that there is no longer
any room in the world for the German.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Society has organized itself against the
rattlesnake and the yellow fever. Shepherds
have entered into a conspiracy to exterminate
the wolves. The Boards of Health
are planning to wipe out typhoid, cholera
and the Black Plague. Not otherwise, lovers
of their fellow man have finally become
perfectly hopeless with reference to the
German people. They have no more relations
to the civilization of 1918 than an
orang-outang, a gorilla, a Judas, a hyena, a
thumbscrew, a scalping knife in the hands
of a savage. These brutes must be cast out
of society.</p>

<p>Some of us, hoping against hope, after the
reluctant confession of the truth of the German
atrocities, have appealed to education.
We knew that Tacitus said, nearly two thousand
years ago, that "the German treats
women with cruelty, tortures his enemies,
and associates kindness with weakness." But
nineteen centuries of education have not
changed the German one whit. The mere
catalogue of the crimes committed by German
officers and soldiers and set forth in
more than twenty volumes of proofs destroys
the last vestige of hope for their future.
Think of the catalogue! Babies nailed like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
rats to the doors of houses! Children skewered
on a bayonet midst the cheers of marching
Germans&mdash;as if the child were a quail,
skewered on a fork! Matrons, old men and
priests slaughtered; young Italian officers
with throats cut and hanging on hooks in
butchers' shops; the bombing of Red Cross
hospitals and nurses and the white flag;
everything achieved by civilized man defiled
and destroyed&mdash;reverence for childhood and
age, the sanctity of womanhood, the standards
of honour, fidelity to treaties and all
destroyed, not in a mood of drunkenness or
a fit of rage, but on a deliberate, cold, calculated
policy of German frightfulness.</p>

<p>The sense of hopelessness as to civilizing
the German and keeping him as an element
in the new society grew out of the breakdown
of education and science in changing the
German of the time of Tacitus. Plainly the
time has come to make full confession of the
fact that education can change the size but
not the sort. The German in the time of
Tacitus was ignorant when he took the children
of his enemy and dashed their brains
out against the wall; the German of 1914
and 1918 still butchers children, the only
difference being that the butchery is now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
more efficient and better calculated, through
scientific cruelty, to stir horror and spread
frightfulness. The leopard has not changed
its spots. The rattlesnake is larger and has
more poison in the sac; the German wolf
has increased in size, and where once he tore
the throat of two sheep, now he can rend
ten lambs in half the time. In utter despair,
therefore, statesmen, generals, diplomats,
editors are now talking about the duty
of simply exterminating the German people.
There will shortly be held a meeting of surgeons
in this country. A copy of the preliminary
call lies before me. The plan to be
discussed is based upon the Indiana State
law. That law authorizes a State Board of
Surgeons to use upon the person of confirmed
criminals and hopeless idiots the new painless
method of sterilizing the men. These surgeons
are preparing to advocate the calling
of a world conference to consider the sterilization
of the ten million German soldiers,
and the segregation of their women, that
when this generation of German goes, civilized
cities, states and races may be rid of
this awful cancer that must be cut clean out
of the body of society.</p>

<h2 class="lu">THE BLACK<br />
SOUL OF THE HUN</h2>

<h2>III</h2>


<h3>1. German Barbarism Not Barbarism to
the German</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Strictly</span> speaking, the only man who
thoroughly understands the cruelty of
the Germans is the German himself. No
American or Englishman, no Belgian or
Frenchman has the gift of telepathy that
enables him to know what is going on in
the German mind that guides the German's
hand in committing his horrible atrocities.
Now and then, in a moment when he is off
guard, an occasional German reveals the explanation,
and we look in, just as John
Bunyan's pilgrim saw the door into Hades
opened by a little crack, through which he
looked upon the flames. Not otherwise was
it with that German in Baltimore, who
recently exposed the German mind, and
from the German view-point explained the
Germans in their hour of brutality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>During a most intimate and personal conversation
with a banker, this German, the
other day, explained his people's atrocities
by saying that what is barbarism and
atrocities to England, France or the United
States is not barbarism at all to the Germans.
In proof of this astounding statement
the German gave this personal incident of
his boyhood. He said that in his gymnasium
there was another boy who had something
that he wanted. When the opportunity
came, being the stronger, he jumped upon
the other boy, beat him up terribly and
made him a cripple for life. On reaching
his home he showed his parents what he had
stolen, and he was patted on the back,
praised for his might with his fists, and told
that that was the method he was to follow
in after life.</p>

<p>He insisted that this sort of thing was
drilled into every German boy, and for that
reason it never once even occurred to him
that he had done wrong. "After I became
a man I settled in America, and as I came to
understand the spirit of American civilization
it grew upon me that I had committed a
crime, and now for twenty-two years, as
some atonement for my sin, I have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
supporting that crippled man and his
widowed mother."</p>

<p>The modern banker has become a sort of
confessor, and to the banker many sins are
revealed as once to the priest. Nothing is
more significant than this German confession
and his philosophy of the German atrocity.
In his own written letter concerning that
crime of his boyhood this German adds:
"Had I remained in Germany no one would
ever have thought of suggesting to me that
I had done wrong, and it would never have
entered into my head that I was under any
obligation to the man I had maimed. In
the light of American civilization I understand
the difference, and I am seeking to
atone for my sin, but all Germans have been
taught, as I was taught. The Germans,
therefore, in their campaign of frightfulness,
are committing deeds which from the view-point
of American civilization are barbarous,
but from the view-point of Germans are not
crimes at all."</p>

<p>The significance of this frank confession of
a German, his story of how America had redeemed
his soul out of the spirit of force and
cruelty into the spirit of kindness, humanity
and justice, reveals more of the real nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the German beast and the Potsdam gang
than a thousand volumes on the philosophy
of German atrocities. The simple fact is
that the crimes of the Germans are abominable
atrocities to us, but that intellectually
and morally the German officer and soldier
simply do not know what we mean by our
horror and the wave of moral indignation
that has swept over the earth. Jesse Pomeroy
used to pull canary birds apart, and
tortured children to death. But the boy
was deficient in the nerve of humanity. He
simply stared with blank eyes when the
judge and the jury condemned him. He
was incapable of knowing what the excitement
over the dead body was about. On
the side of compassion and humanity the
German is, as it were, colour blind, is without
musical sense, and the nerves of kindness
and humanity are atrophied. The ordinary
German prisoner when shown the bodies left
behind after the flight of the German army
simply looks blankly at the mutilated corpse
and exclaims: "Well, what of it? Why
not? Why shouldn't we?" and shrugs his
shoulders, taking it as a matter of course.
That is another reason why a great number
of American business men, bankers, merchants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
manufacturers, scholars, statesmen,
have reluctantly been forced to the conviction
that the ten millions of German soldiers
should be painlessly sterilized, that the German
people (saving only the remnant who
accept Jesus' idea of compassion and kindness
towards God's poor and weak) should be
allowed to die out of the world. Re-read,
therefore, what this German has said about
the teaching of his German parents and the
German people in praise of cruelty, and how
for twenty years now, redeemed by life in
the United States, he has tried to make
atonement by supporting the man whom he
had crippled, and also his mother. Who
shall explain to us the reason why German
barbarism is not barbarism to the Germans?
Why, this German shall explain it, through
his personal experience as a criminal. But
the day will come when the Potsdam gang
and ten million German soldiers will stand
before the judgment seat of God. And
what shall be the verdict then pronounced?
You will find it in the New Testament:
"'Out of thine own mouth will I judge
thee,' thou wicked and cruel German!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h3>2. The German "Science of Lying"</h3>

<p>For the first time in history a nation has
organized lying into a science and taught
deceit as an art.</p>

<p>At the very time when the diplomats of
the world have refused any form of secrecy
and insist upon publishing all international
treaties and doing everything in the open,
Germany has organized lying into a national
science. Even Maximilian Harden, editor of
<i>Zukunft</i>, openly acknowledges this in one of
his editorials reproduced in the papers of
Denmark and Holland.</p>

<p>Harden comes right out in the open. He
tells the German people that at the beginning
of the war it was necessary to say to
the world that Germany was fighting a defensive
war, that her back was against the
wall, that those wicked enemies named England
and France, Russia and Belgium were
leaping upon her like wolves.</p>

<p>Of course, says Harden, at first that was
good diplomacy, but now that we are successful,
"Why say this any longer? Let
the Kaiser and his Chancellor tell the world
plainly that we decided upon this war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
twenty-five years ago; that during all of
these years we were preparing cannons and
shells; that we drilled ten million men
against 'Der Tag'; that we wanted this
war, that we planned this war, that we
forced this war and that we are proud of it."</p>

<p>With one stroke Harden has torn off the
mask. He exhibits the Kaiser as the prince
of liars. If his words mean anything, they
mean that what has long been surmised is
absolutely true, namely, that Germany wished
some one would kill the Austrian Prince and
Princess so as to start the war, for which
Berlin had prepared everything, down to the
last buckle on the harness of the horses.</p>

<p>General von Bissing is not less open.
Dying men are not apt to tell lies. When
he saw that the end was coming the Governor-General
of Belgium prepared what he
called his "last will and testament."</p>

<p>As a close and intimate friend of the
Kaiser, he left a letter with his will asking
the German Government carefully to consider
his wishes. He says plainly that all of
the statements that Berlin never intended to
annex Belgium were pure camouflage. He
urges the Berlin office to flatly declare its
purpose never to give up a foot of the Belgian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
coast nor an acre of the conquered territory
of north France and Belgium.</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence," he says, "that
we have given a solemn pledge not to annex
Belgium. Why not tell the world that we
will have failed in the one thing for which
we set out if we evacuate Belgium? We
need Belgium's coast line for our shipping."</p>

<p>He adds that Germany has used twenty-three
million tons of Belgian coal and has
taken as much more iron ore out of France's
basin in Briey. "We cannot live and compete
with France and England if we give up
the coal and iron mines that we have conquered
and the harbours that we have won."</p>

<p>Having affirmed, therefore, that the German
Government lied at the beginning in
claiming that they entered Belgium fighting
a defensive warfare, General von Bissing
cast about for some one behind whom he can
hide as a screen and who can be used as an
authority for lying. He finds his guide and
leader in "The Prince," written by Machiavelli.
That book has often been called
the treatise on the art of lying. Never was
such cunning exhibited. Never was the
father of lies invoked with such skill as by
the German leaders. In their sight truth is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
contemptible, kindness is weakness, honour is
a figment.</p>

<p>But the individual, the city, or the empire
that builds its life on lies builds its house on
sand. Soon the rains will descend and the
floods come, the winds will blow, and the
house will fall, and great will be the fall of
it.</p>

<p>The German is like a thirsty man who
tries to quench his thirst by drinking scalding
water. He is like a hungry man who
tries to satisfy his appetite by eating red-hot
coals.</p>


<h3>3. The Malignity of the German Spies</h3>

<p>Disturbed by many events in their city,
the Secret Service men guard very carefully
the speakers for the Liberty Loan, the Red
Cross or the Y. M. C. A. hut work. Fearing
lest some German agent might injure the
good name of their town, the Secret Service
men of a certain community recently told the
following incident, merely as a warning to
all public speakers who might, by their
words, arouse the enmity of half-balanced
German fanatics. Because it was intended
to put us all upon our guard, and because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
no interest could possibly be injured, but
many persons be benefited, the incident is
here set forth in detail. The speaker was
a young lawyer, of position, influence and
fine education, who was serving his country
during the period of the war.</p>

<p>"One morning I received my assignment
through a sealed envelope. Experience told
me that I was to take up the work of some
other Secret Service man and complete the
task. Of course, one Secret Service man
does not know who else is in the service.
Since the war began we go by numbers,
rather than by our names. When I opened
my envelope I found these directions: 'Go
to No. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;. Wait until there is no
customer in the tobacco store. Then put
down on the counter two ten-cent pieces, and
say to the woman, "I want that package of
green leaf tobacco." When you have left
the store, open the package, and you will
find full directions therein.' I followed the
instructions strictly, and out on the street I
opened the package, and found a large key
and a small one, with these words written:
'Go to No. so-and-so (mentioning a third-class
little apartment house in one of the
worst districts in the city). The large key<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
will open room No. 14. The small key will
open a little writing table in the room. In
the drawer of that table you will find full
directions.'</p>

<p>"I soon found the apartment house,
climbed to the second floor, found my large
key turning in the lock, and the small key
opened the drawer in the desk. In that
drawer I found these words: 'The man we
want is in the adjoining room. He will
come in about seven o'clock, but he may not
come until eleven or twelve. It is important
that we have his testimony. Don't wound
him seriously or kill him. You will find a
hole bored through the door between your
room and his. That hole is filled with
putty, but underneath the putty is wax.
Warm the wire in the drawer in the gas
jet and melt the wax.'</p>

<p>"I waited until eleven o'clock for the man
to come in. For a while he sat on the bed,
with his back towards me. He was reading.
Finally he lifted his pillow to shake it up,
and I caught sight of a big revolver under
the pillow. For several reasons I decided
to do nothing until he had fallen asleep. I
kept my ear glued to that little hole for one
hour after he turned out his light. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
he was sleeping soundly I went into the hall,
with my skeleton key turned the lock in the
door, and then with my lantern in the left
hand and my revolver in the right made one
bound into the room, struck my light and
my revolver into his face under the light
and shouted: 'Hands up!' Within three
minutes I had him handcuffed and within
ten had him bound. In that room, when
the police came at my call, we found enough
chemicals and powerful explosives to have
blown up the entire block. In his satchel
were found incriminating letters, secret documents,
and, with their help, we soon landed
the entire crowd. All have now been taken
care of. Their flames were stamped out before
they were kindled." That one incident
was only one of a series of closely-related
dramatic events. Outwardly, life in that
city is very safe, simple and straightforward,
but as to the forces of evil, the anarchists,
the I. W. W.'s and German plotters the patriot
can only say that but for the Secret
Service and the police and the Department
of Justice, society could not go on for one
single month.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<h3>4. The Cancer in the Body-Politic of
Germany</h3>

<p>To-day, physicians and surgeons count the
cancer man's deadliest enemy. Every year
this baffling disease takes large and larger
toll of human life. From time to time experts
come together to plan its limitation,
but meanwhile the terrible disease increases.
Addressing a company of experts recently,
a great physician exclaimed: "Even if we
can stop its growth by radium, it still remains
for us to get rid of the growth itself.
There seems to be no way to lift the evil
cells out save through the knife, after which
nature must heal the wound. Science knows
no other way." Plainly, no magic can be
invoked. No miracle assists the surgeon.
His one recourse is to the knife, and after
that the healing forces of nature.</p>

<p>Let us confess that the knife has a large
place in the extermination of social diseases.
Militarism is a cancer on the German body-politic,
just as slavery was once a cancer
fastened on the fair body of the great South.
That disease had fastened itself upon the
South many years before the Civil War.
Like a cancer, it spread its roots throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the whole social and economic structure of
the Southern States. It poisoned trade. Its
virus was in the body of law. It destroyed
kindness and sympathy for the weak.
Slavery debased the poor white working-man.
It made the white fathers of mulatto
children so cruel that they sold their own
flesh and blood. Overseers became brutes.
Slave drivers stood up and bid upon their
own children in the auction markets. Slowly
the disease spread. Men became alarmed.
They tried everything excepting the knife
held in the hand of war surgeons. Clay
recognized the cancer in the body politic.
He proposed compromise as a poultice.
Garrison and Phillips proposed the amputation
of the diseased limb. John Brown tried
to put sulphuric acid upon the sore spots and
eat it out through the flames of insurrection.
Lincoln knew that it was a case of life or
death. The Republic could not endure half
slave and half free. All measures failed.
Finally the god of war went forth and lifted
a knife heated red hot and cut the foul
cancer out of the body and saved the fair
South. When many years had passed nature
healed the wound and saved the life of the
Republic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Germany, Austria and Turkey to-day are
patients in a world hospital. It is plain that
they are stricken with death. The foul
cancer of militarism has fastened itself upon
Germany. The cancer of autocracy is eating
into the vitals of Austria. The cancer
of polygamy is enmeshed in the life of
Turkey. Of late the disease has been
spreading. Now these surgeons, named
Foch, Haig and Pershing, have been
anointed by the ointment of war black and
sulphurous, and, lifting their scalpel, these
men have been ordained to cut out the foul
growth from the body-politic of Germany.
Perchance there is still enough vital force
left therein to heal the wound after the
disease has been removed. Meanwhile, the
sick man of Turkey struggles. The patient
hates the knife. The diseased body will not
have the only instrument that holds possible
cure, and yet, despite all his struggle, the
disease must come out. Slowly the surgical
process goes on. One root at Verdun was
cut, and now another is being sundered in the
West. Much blood flows, but the blood is
black and foul. Every cell in the German
body-politic seems to be diseased. Medicines
must be found. The stimulants of sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ethics and morals must be invoked&mdash;after
that it is a question of the recuperative
forces of intellect and conscience in the German
people. These forces alone can heal
the wound left after the foul cancer has been
cut away. To-day, men with a large mind,
blessed with magnanimity, kindness and
good-will must stay their hearts upon history,
that shows us that in the past in our own
country slavery was a cancer cut out by the
surgeons of war, and that after a long time
the great South recovered its health, its
beauty and its usefulness.</p>


<h3>5. Polygamy and the Collapse of the
Family in Germany</h3>

<p>The unexpected influences of this war
upon Germany herself is a striking consideration.
Few men anticipated the far-off results
of the Kaiser's alliance with the Sultan
and his polygamous philosophy. During the
past two years the German newspapers,
magazines and debates in the Reichstag have
been filled with startling suggestions concerning
the family. The <i>Berliner Lokalanzeiger</i>,
on March 7, 1916, published a statement
urging that "every girl should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
given the right on reaching twenty-five
years to have one child born out of wedlock,
for which she should receive from the state
an annual allowance."</p>

<p>Dr. Krohne, in his address before the
House, says: "The decline of the birth rate
in Germany has proceeded three times as fast
as in the preceding twenty-five years. No
civilized nation has hitherto experienced so
large a decline in so short a time. Our annual
number of births falls already to-day by
560,000 below what we had a right to expect.
We should have to-day 2,500,000
more inhabitants than we have." Commenting
thereupon, the <i>Berliner Lokalanzeiger</i>
demands that "illegitimate children should
be put socially and morally on a level with
the legitimate."</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Kaiser cast about for
an alliance with some man who could be his
bosom friend and could love what he loves,
the Kaiser chose the Sultan with his polygamy
and the Moslem teaching with its
harem. No British or French officer, therefore,
was surprised when documents like the
following began to be found on the dead
bodies of young German officers. This document
is a verbatim and absolutely accurate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
copy of one of the many now deposited in
the various departments of Justice and the
War Departments in Havre and Paris:</p>

<p>"Soldiers, a danger assails the Fatherland
by reason of its dwindling birth rate. The
cradles of Germany are empty to-day; it is
your duty to see that they are filled. You
bachelors, when your leave comes, marry at
once the girl of your choice. Make her your
wife without delay. The Fatherland needs
healthy children. You married men and
your wives should put jealousy from your
minds and consider whether you have not
also a duty to the Fatherland. You should
consider whether you may not honourably
contract an alliance with one of the million
of bachelor women. See if your wife will
not sanction the relation. Remember, all of
you, the empty cradles of Germany must be
filled.</p>

<p>"Your name has been given us as a capable
man, and you are herewith requested to
take on this office of honour, and to do your
duty in a proper German way. It must here
be pointed out that your wife or fianc&eacute;e will
not be able to claim a divorce. It is, in fact,
hoped that the women will bear this discomfort
heroically for the sake of the war. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
will be given the district of &mdash;&mdash;. Should
you not feel capable of carrying on the task
allotted to you, you will be given three days
on which to name some one in your place.
On the other hand, if you are prepared to
take on a second district as well you will become
'drekoffizier' and receive a pension.
An exhibition of photographs of women and
maidens in the district allotted to you is to
be seen at the office of &mdash;&mdash;. You are
requested to bring this letter with you."</p>

<p>This is an amazing document. Plainly the
German family has broken down. But no
household can be built on free love in 1918,
just as no stone building can be erected on
hay, stubble or sand. The German family
has gone, and German society is tottering
towards its final ruin.</p>


<h3>6. The Red-Hot Swords in Sister Julie's
Eyes</h3>

<p>The history of heroism holds nothing finer
than the story of Sister Julie, decorated by
the French Government with the Cross of
the Legion of Honour. She lived in the little
village of Gerb&eacute;viller, now called "Gerb&eacute;viller
the Martyred." On August 27th the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
French army broke the line of the German
Crown Prince and compelled the Huns' retreat.
General Clauss was ordered to go
northeast and dig in on the top of the ridge
some twelve miles north of Gerb&eacute;viller. The
Germans reached the village at nine o'clock
in the morning, and by half-past twelve they
had looted all the houses and were ready
to burn the doomed city. The incendiary
wagons were filled with the firebrands
stamped 1912. Beginning at the southern
end of the village, the German officers and
soldiers looted every house, shop, store and
public building, and then set fire to the town.
At last they came to the extreme northern
end, where a few houses and the little hospital
over which Sister Julie had charge,
were still standing.</p>

<p>About noon a German colonel with the
blazing firebrand in his right hand stood in
front of Sister Julie's house. It has been
said that there are flaming swords in the
eyes of every good woman. In that terrible
hour the face of Sister Julie proved the
proverb. She told the German officer that
these few houses that were left were filled
with wounded French soldiers, with here
and there a wounded German. The Hun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
answered that his men would remove the
Germans who were wounded, but that the
buildings must be fired. Behind him were
several hundred buildings blazing like one
fiery furnace. Sister Julie stood squarely
across the path of the Hun. "While I live
you shall not enter. You shall not kill these
dying men. I swear it by this crucifix!
Your hands are already red with blood.
God dwells within this house. Look at this
figure of Jesus, who said, 'Woe unto him
that offends against one of my little ones.
These shall go away into everlasting hell.'
I myself will bear witness against you. You
have murdered our fifteen old men. All
their lives long these old men did us good
and not evil. Look at the little girls you
have slain. God Himself will strike you
dead." General Clauss stood dumb. He
was embarrassed beyond all words. Fear
also got hold upon him. He turned and
disappeared into a group of his soldiers.
Two or three minutes passed by. A German
colonel came to Sister Julie. He told
her that the houses used for wounded soldiers
would be spared by General Clauss
provided Sister Julie would agree to continue
her ministrations to the wounded Germans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
lying in her hospital. As General
Clauss already knew that this had already
been done, and would be, the Germans
marched away, leaving the hospital buildings
uninjured. It was a victory of the soul
of a noble woman.</p>

<p>One morning last summer Sister Julie
showed her decorations. Her face was kind,
gentle and motherly. Her atmosphere was
peace and serenity. She seemed a tower of
strength. It must have been easy for dying
French boys in those rooms to have identified
Sister Julie with Mary the Mother, who
saw her son dying on the cross. Later on
we met an aged woman of martyred Gerb&eacute;viller.
She had been nursing in the hospital
and had stood behind Sister Julie when
she forbade General Clauss to light the firebrands.
"What did Sister Julie say?" we
asked the old woman. "Oh, sir, I do not
know, and yet I do know. She told them
that she would ask God to strike them dead.
In that moment I was afraid of her. She
seemed to me more to be feared than General
Clauss and all his wicked army. I can
tell you what our good priest says about
Sister Julie." "And what is that?" The
old woman could not quote the verse accurately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
but from what she said we were soon
guided to a chapter in the old Bible, and
there was the verse that described Sister
Julie, with arms uplifted at the door of her
hospital and denying access to General
Clauss. The verse was this: "And lo! an
angel with a flaming sword stood at the gate
and kept the garden."</p>


<h3>7. The Hidden Dynamite; the Hun's
Destruction of Cathedrals</h3>

<p>In one group of ruined cellars that was
once a splendid French city, there is a beautiful
building standing. It is rich with the
art and architecture of the sixteenth century.
The lines are most graceful and the structure
is the fulfillment of Keats' line: "A thing
of beauty is a joy forever." Such a building
belongs not to the French nation, but to
the whole human race. An architect like
the man who planned this noble building is
born only once in a thousand years. Every
visitor to that ruined town asks himself this
question: "Why did the Germans allow this
building to remain?" An incident of the
story of Bapaume throws a flood of light
upon the problem.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>One year ago, when the Germans were retreating
from Bapaume, they looted every
house, burned or dynamited every building
save the H&ocirc;tel de Ville. That city hall the
Germans left standing in all its majesty and
beauty. In front of the building they
placed a placard containing in substance the
statement that they left this building as a
monument to Germany's love of art and
architecture.</p>

<p>Secretly, however, in the cellar of this
noble building the Germans buried several
tons of dynamite. To this dynamite they
attached a seven-day clock. They set the
seven-day clock to explode at eleven o'clock
one week after the Germans had retreated.
These beasts worked out the theory that the
largest possible number of British and French
officers and public men would be inspecting
the building at that hour of the day.</p>

<p>The plot was successful. Their devilish
cunning was rewarded and their hate glutted.
The clock struck the detonator, the dynamite
exploded, blew the building and the
visitors into atoms. Standing in the ruined
public square, one sees nothing but that
great shell pit where the earth opened up its
mouth and swallowed a monument builded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to beauty and grandeur. This other building,
therefore, that stands in the city fifty
miles to the south of Bapaume is there for
the sole reason that the seven-day clock
failed to explode the dynamite&mdash;not because
of any love of architecture that possessed the
Germans. It is there to tell us that some
part of the mechanism of death failed to
connect.</p>

<p>In analyzing the German mind nothing is
more certain than the fact that they lack a
fine sense of humour and are often quite
devoid of imagination.</p>

<p>As for sculpture, nothing can be more
hideous than the statues of the fifteen
Prussian kings that do not decorate, but
simply vulgarize, the avenue leading towards
Magdeburg. The vast broad statue of
Hindenburg, to which the Germans come to
drive nails and scratch their names in lead
pencils, reminds one of the occasional public
buildings in this country defaced by thoughtless
and vulgar boys. Nor is there anything
in the world as ugly as the German sculptor's
statue of the present Kaiser out at Potsdam
Palace, unless it be the statue of an Indian
in front of a tobacco store down in Smithville,
Indian Territory, though even this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
doubtful. It hardly seems possible that one
earth only 7,000 miles in diameter could hold
two statues as ugly as that of the Kaiser!</p>

<p>It is this singular lack of imagination and
failure to understand the beautiful that explains
the systematic destruction by the
German army of the glorious cathedrals, the
fourteenth century churches, libraries, ch&acirc;teaux
and h&ocirc;tels des villes that were the
glory and beauty of France.</p>

<p>"If we cannot have these vineyards and
orchards," said the Germans, "Frenchmen
shall not have them."</p>

<p>So they turned the land into a desert.
Not otherwise the German seems to feel
that if he cannot build structures as beautiful
as these glorious buildings in France that he
will not leave one of them standing.</p>

<p>Next to the Parthenon in Athens and
St. Peter's in Rome, perhaps the world's
best loved and most admired building was
the Cathedral of Rheims. There Joan of
Arc crowned Charles IX; there for centuries
the noblest men of France had gone
to receive their offices and their honours. A
building that belonged to the world. What
treasures of beauty for the whole human
race in the thousand and more statues in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
cathedral! How priceless the twelfth-century
stained glass! What paintings which
have come down from the masters of Italy!
Whoever visited the library and the Cardinal's
palace without exclaiming: "What
beautiful missals! What illuminated manuscripts?"</p>

<p>Fully conscious of the fact that they were
impotent to produce such treasures the Germans,
unable to get closer to the cathedral
than four miles, determined to destroy them.
Day after day they bombed the noble
cathedral. Gone now, too, the great stone
roof! Fallen the flying buttresses, ruined
the chapels. Perished all the tapestries, the
rugs and the laces. Water stands in puddles
on the floor. The cathedral is a blackened
shell.</p>

<p>The victim of grievous ingratitude, King
Lear, was turned out into the snow and hail
by his wicked daughters; and the white-haired
old king wandered through the blackness
of the night beneath the falling hail.
And, lo! the Cathedral of Rheims is a King
Lear in architecture&mdash;broken, wounded, exposed
to the hails of the autumn and the
snow of the winter, through the coarseness
and vandalism of the Germans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The German Foreign Minister put it all in
one word: "Let the neutrals cease their
everlasting chatter about the destruction of
Rheims Cathedral. All the paintings, statues
and cathedrals in the world are not so much
as one straw to the Germans over against
the gaining of our goal and the conquest of
their land."</p>

<p>Never was a truer word spoken. The
German lacks the imagination and the gift
of the love of the beautiful. He would
prefer one bologna sausage factory and one
brewery to the Parthenon, with St. Peter's
and Rheims Cathedral thrown in.</p>


<h3>8. The German Sniper Who Hid Behind
the Crucifix</h3>

<p>For hundreds of years the French peasants
have loved the crucifix. Many a beautiful
woman carries a little gold cross with the
figure of Jesus fastened thereto, and from
time to time draws it out to press the crucifix
to her lips. Even in the harvest fields and
beside the road, travellers find the carved
figure of the Saviour lifted up to draw poor,
ignorant and sinful men to His own level.</p>

<p>One of the most glorious pieces of carving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in France was wrought in walnut by a great
sculptor and lifted up on a tree in the midst
of an estate, where the peasants, resting from
their work, could refresh their souls by love
and faith and prayer.</p>

<p>One day last summer, during the Teuton
advance, a German officer stood beneath
that divine figure. Mentally he marked the
place. That night when the darkness fell a
company of German officers returned to that
spot. One of them climbed up on the tree.
He found that the carved figure of Jesus
was life size.</p>

<p>With the end of a rope a little platform
was drawn up level with the foot of the
crucifix. Two ropes were fastened to the
outstretched arms of the Saviour. Another
rope was fastened around the neck of Jesus,
until the platform was made safe. Then a
German sniper with his gun climbed up on
the platform. He laid his rifle upon the
shoulders of the Divine Figure, hiding his
body behind that of Jesus. The German officer
must have chuckled with satisfaction,
for he knew that he had found a screen behind
which a murderer might hide, and the
German villain was quite right in his
psychology.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>It was true that the French soldiers loved
that beautiful figure. To them the crucifix
was sacred. So beautiful were their ideals,
so lofty their spirit, so pure and high their
imagination, that they were incapable of conceiving
that a German could use the sacred
crucifix as a screen from which to send forth
his murderous hail.</p>

<p>The green boughs of that tree hid the
little puff of smoke. From time to time a
French soldier would fall dead with a hole
through his forehead. Once a French officer
threw up his hands while the blood streamed
from his mouth and he pitched forward dead.</p>

<p>At last the French soldiers understood.
There was a sniper behind Christ's cross.
The French could have turned their cannon
against that tree, but instead they simply
kept below the trench until the night fell.
Then in the darkness some French boys took
their lives in their hands and crawled on
hands and knees across No Man's Land.
Lying on their backs they cut the wires
above their heads.</p>

<p>By some strange providence they dropped
safely into the German trench and crawled
ten yards beyond. Then they climbed into
the tree, removed that glorious crucifix with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the carved figure, brought it back in safety
and at daybreak turned their cannon on the
tree and blew the platform to pieces.</p>

<p>Foul Huns had made a screen of that
sacred figure, but the French were not willing
to injure their ideals by shooting the
crucifix to pieces.</p>

<p>To-day all the world despises the Germans.
Nothing is sacred to them. Their
souls are dead within them and when the
soul dies, everything dies.</p>

<p>The German's body may live on for twenty
years, but you might as well pronounce the
funeral address to-day, for the soul of Germany
is dead. Nothing but a physical fighting
machine now remains.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, France lives. Never were
her ideals so lofty and pure. That is why
the world loves France. She has kept faith
with her ideals.</p>


<h3>9. The Ruined Studio</h3>

<p>I have in my possession several photographs
of a ruined studio. Some twenty or
thirty Germans dashed into a little French
village one day, and demanded at the point
of their automatic pistols the surrender by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the women of their rings, jewelry, money
and their varied treasure. At the edge of
the village was a simple little summer-house,
in which one of the French artists had his
studio. He had been in that valley for three
months, sketching, and working very hard.
Knowing that they had but a little time in
which to do their work as vandals, the Huns
started to ruin the studio. With big knives
they cut the fine canvases into ruins. They
knocked down the marbles, and the bronzes;
the little bust from the hand of Rodin
was smashed with a hammer. The bronze
brought from Rome was pounded until the
face was ruined. One blow of the hammer
smashed the Chinese pottery, another broke
the plates and the porcelain into fragments.
Then every corner of the room was defiled,
and the pigs fled from their filthy stye.
Across one of the canvases the German
officer wrote the words, "This is my trademark."
And every other part of the canvas
was cut to ribbons with his knife. No more
convincing evidence of the real German character
can possibly be found than these photographs
of the interior of that ruined studio.</p>

<p>Here we have the reason why the Kaiser
himself, who knew the German through and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
through, called his people Huns. Long ago
the first Huns entered Italy. They found a
city of marble, ivory, and silver. They left
it a heap and a ruin. They had no understanding
of a palace; they did not know
what a picture meant, or a marble; they
were irritated by the superiority of the
Roman. What they could not understand
they determined to destroy. That is one of
the reasons why all the marbles and bronzes
that we have in Italy are marred and injured.
The head of Jupiter is cracked; the
Venus di Milo has no arms; Aphrodite has
been repaired with plaster; Apollo has lost
a part of his neck and one leg. From time
to time an old marble is dug up in a field,
where some ploughman has chanced upon
the treasure. Owners hid their beautiful
statues, ivories and bronzes, to save them
from the vandals. Unfortunately, the modern
Huns rushed into the French towns,
riding in automobiles, and sculptors and
painters had no time to hide their treasures.
The great cathedrals could not be hidden.
The Kaiser in one of his recent statements
boasted that he had destroyed seventy-three
cathedrals in Belgium and France. It is all
too true. From the beginning, the Cathedral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of Rheims, dear to the whole world, and
glorious through the associations of Jeanne
d'Arc, was doomed, because the Germans,
having no treasure of their own, and incapable
of producing such a cathedral, determined
that France should not have that
treasure. The other day, in Kentucky, a
negro jockey came in at the tail end of
a race, ten rods behind his rival. That night,
the negro bought a pint of whiskey, and determined
to have vengeance, so he went out
at midnight, and cut the hamstrings of the
beautiful horse that had defeated his own
beast. Now that is precisely the spirit that
animated the German War Staff and the
men that have devastated France and Belgium,
and every man who has witnessed
these German crimes with his own eyes
will never be the same person again. His
whole attitude towards the Hun is an attitude
of horror and revulsion. A certain
noble anger burns within him, as burned that
noble passion in Dante against those criminals
who spoiled Florence of her treasures.</p>


<h3>10. Was This Murder Justified?</h3>

<p>One raw, December day, in 1914, an
American gentleman, widely known as traveller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and correspondent, was in a hospital
in London, recovering from his wound, received
in Belgium. He was startled by the
appearance of an old Belgian priest, and a
young Belgian woman. The American author
was travelling in Belgium at the time
of the German invasion. Quite unexpectedly
he was caught behind the lines, near Louvain.
Having heard his statement, the German
officer recognized its truthfulness and
sincerity, and insisted that this American
scholar should be his guest at the Belgian
ch&acirc;teau of which he had just taken possession.
The German had already shot the
Belgian owner, and one or two of the servants,
who defended their master. To the
horror and righteous anger of the American,
the German officer took his place at the
head of the table, waved the American to
his seat, and ordered the young Belgian
woman to perform her duties as hostess. In
that tense moment, it was a matter of life
and death to disobey. That German officer
had his way, not only with the young Belgian
wife, half dazed, half crazed, wholly
broken in spirit, but with the American
whom he sent forward to Brussels.</p>

<p>Plunged into the midst of many duties in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
connection with Americans and refugees who
had to be gotten out of Belgium into England,
this American author had to put aside
temporarily any plan for the release of that
young Belgian woman held in bondage.
Later, when he was wounded, the American
crossed to London for medical help. When
the old Belgian priest and that young woman
stood at the foot of his bed in the hospital
in London, all the events of that terrible
hour in the dining-room of the Belgian
ch&acirc;teau returned, and once more he lived
through that frightful scene. The purpose
of the visit soon became evident. The old
Belgian priest stated the problem. He began
by saying that God alone could take
human life since God alone could give it.
He urged that the sorrow of the young
woman's present was as nothing in comparison
to the loss of her soul should she be
guilty of infanticide. It was the plea of a
man who lived for the old ideals. His white
hair, his gentle face, his pure disinterested
spirit lent weight to his words. Then came
the statement of the young Belgian woman.
She told the American author of the dreadful
days and weeks that followed after his
departure, that every conceivable agony was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
wrought upon her, and that now within a
few months, she must have a child by that
wicked German officer. She cried out that
the very babe would be unclean, that it
would be born a monster, that it was as if
she was bringing into the world an evil
thing, doomed in advance to direst hell.
That every day and every hour she felt that
poison was running through her veins. She
turned upon the old priest, saying, "You insist
that God alone gives life! Nay, no, no, no!
It was a German devil that gave me this
life that now throbs within my body! And
every moment I feel that that life is pollution.
German blood is poisoned blood.
German blood is like putrefaction and decay,
soiling my innermost life." The young
woman wept, prayed, plead, and finally in
her desperation cried out, "Then I decide
for myself! The responsibility is mine. I
alone will bear it." And out of the hospital
she swept with the dignity and beauty of the
Lady of Sorrows.</p>

<p>A year later, in Paris, the French judge
and court cleared the young girl who choked
to death with a string the babe of the German
officer who had attacked her. But
since that time, all France and Belgium and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the lands where there are refugees are
discussing the question&mdash;Where does the
right lie? Has the French mother, cruelly
wounded, no right? And this foul thing
forced upon her a superior right? Which
path for the bewildered girl leads to peace?
Where does the Lord of Right stand? What
chance has a babe born of a beast, abhorred
and despised, when it comes into the world?
The women of the world alone can answer
this question.</p>

<h2 class="lu">IN FRANCE<br />
THE IMMORTAL!</h2>

<h2>IV</h2>


<h3>1. The Glory of the French Soldier's
Heroism</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> much as the German atrocities have
done to destroy our confidence in the
divine origin of the human soul, the French
soldiers have done to vindicate the majesty
and beauty of a soul made in the image of
God.</p>

<p>I have seen French boys that were so
simple, brave and modest in their courage,
so beautiful in their spirit, as to make one
feel that they were young gods and not men.
One day, into one of the camps, came a
lawyer from Paris. He brought the news
of the revival of the Latin Quarter. For
nearly three years a shop near the Beaux
Arts had been closed. During all this time
the French soldier had been at the front.
When the first call came on that August day
he put up the wooden shutters, turned the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
key in the lock, and marched away to the
trenches.</p>

<p>Said the lawyer: "I come from your
cousin. The Americans are here in Paris.
Your cousin says that if you will give me
the keys and authorize her to open the shop
she will take your place. She can recover
your business, and perhaps have a little store
of money for you when you have your 'permission'
or come home to rest. She tells
me that she is your sole relative." The
soldier shook his head, saying: "I never
expect to come home. I do not want to
come home. France can be freed only by
men who are ready to die for her. I do not
know where the key is. I do not know
what goods are in the shop. For three
years I have had no thought of it. I am
too busy to make money. There are other
things for me&mdash;fighting, and perhaps dying.
Tell my cousin that she can have the shop."
Then the soldier saluted and started back
towards his trench. "Wait! Wait!" cried
the attorney. Then he stooped down, wrote
hurriedly upon his knee, a little paper in
which the soldier authorized his cousin to
carry on the business, in his name. Scrawling
his name to the document, the soldier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
ran towards the place where his heart was&mdash;the
place of peril, heroism and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>This was typical of the thousands of
soldiers at the front, for French soldiers
suffer that the children may never have to
wade through this blood and muck. The foul
creature that has bathed the world in blood
must be slain forever. With the full consent
of the intellect, of the heart and the conscience,
these glorious French boys have
given themselves to God, to freedom, and to
France.</p>


<h3>2. Why the Hun Cannot Defeat the
Frenchman</h3>

<p>One morning in a little restaurant in Paris
I was talking with a British army-captain.
The young soldier was a typical Englishman,
quiet, reserved, but plainly a little excited.
He had just been promoted to his captaincy
and had received one week's "permission"
for a rest in Paris. We had both come
down from near Messines Ridge.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the English captain,
"the French are the greatest soldiers in the
world."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" I answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
"What could be more wonderful than the
heroism, the endurance of the British at
Vimy Ridge? They seem to me more like
young gods than men."</p>

<p>To which the captain answered: "But
you must remember that England has never
been invaded. Look at my company!
Their equipment is right from helmet to
shoe, so perfectly drilled are they that the
swing of their right legs is like the swing of
one pendulum. I will put my British company
against the world. Still I must confess
this, that, so far as I know, no English
division of fifteen thousand men ever came
home at night with more than five thousand
prisoners.</p>

<p>"But look at the French boys at Verdun!
As for clothes, one had a helmet, another a
hat, or a cap, or was bareheaded. One had
red trousers, one had gray trousers and one
had fought until he had only rags left.
When they got within ten rods of the German
trench they were so anxious to reach
the Boche that they forgot to shoot and
lifted up their big bayonets, while they
shouted, 'For God and France!'</p>

<p>"That night when that French division
came back ten thousand strong they brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
more than ten thousand German prisoners
with them to spend the night inside of
barbed wire fences.</p>

<p>"The reason is this: These Frenchmen
fought for home and fireside. They fought
against an invader who had murdered their
daughters and mothers. The Huns will
never defeat France. Before that could
be done," exclaimed the English captain,
"there would not be a man left in France to
explain the reason for his defeat."</p>


<h3>3. "I Am Only His Wife"</h3>

<p>Human life holds many wonderful hours.
Love, marriage, suffering, trouble, are crises
full of romance and destiny, but I question
whether any man ever passed through an
experience more thrilling than the hour in
which he stands at the Charing Cross or
Waterloo Station in London or in the great
station in Paris and watches the hospital
trains come in, loaded with wounded soldiers
brought in after a great battle.</p>

<p>Often fifty thousand men and women line
the streets for blocks, waiting for the trains.
Slowly the wounded boys are lifted from the
car to the cot. Slowly the cot is carried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the ambulance. The nurses speak only in
whispers. The surgeons lift the hand directing
them. You can hear the wings of the
Angel of Death rustling in the air.</p>

<p>When the automobile carrying two
wounded boys moves down the street, the
men and women all uncover while you hear
whispered words, "God bless you!" from
some father or mother who see their own
son in that boy.</p>

<p>Now and then some young girl with
streaming eyes timidly drops a flower into
the front of the ambulance&mdash;pansies for remembrance
and love&mdash;upon a boy whom she
does not know, while she thinks of a boy
whom she knows and loves who is somewhere
in the trenches of France.</p>

<p>One morning a young nurse in the hospital
in Paris received a telegram. It was
from a young soldier, saying: "My pal has
been grievously wounded. He is on the
train that will land this afternoon. He has
a young wife and a little child. You will
find them at such and such a street. I do not
know whether he will live to reach Paris.
Can you see that they are at the station to
meet him? That was his last whispered request
to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon at five o'clock, with her
face pressed between the iron bars, a young
French woman, with a little boy in her arms,
was looking down the long platform. Many,
many cots passed by, and still he did not
come. At last she saw the nurse. The
young wife did not know that her soldier
husband had died while they lifted him out
of the car.</p>

<p>The young nurse said that she never had
undertaken a harder task than that of lifting
the boy in her own arms and leading the
French girl to that cot, that she might know
that henceforth she must look with altered
eyes upon an altered world. A few minutes
passed by and then a miracle of hope had
happened.</p>

<p>"I saw her," said the nurse, "with one
hand upon his hair and the other stretched
upward as she exclaimed: 'I am only his
wife, France is his mother! I am only his
wife, France is his mother! I give him to
France, the mother that reared him!'"</p>


<h3>4. A Soldier's Funeral in Paris</h3>

<p>The two boys were incredibly happy.
Two mornings before they had landed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Paris. What a reception they had had in
the soldiers' club from the splendid French
women! How good the hot bath had
seemed! Clean linen, a fresh shave, a good
breakfast, a soft cot, plenty of blankets,
twenty-four hours' sleep, and they had
wakened up new men. The first morning
they walked along the streets, looking into
the shop windows; in the afternoon one of
the ladies took them to a moving picture
show, and now on the second day here they
were, at a little table before the caf&eacute; in one
of the best restaurants in the Latin Quarter,
with good red wine and black coffee, and
plenty of cigarettes, and not even the boom
of cannon to disturb their conversation.
Strange that in three days they could have
passed from the uttermost of hell to the uttermost
of safety and peace. "These are
good times," said one of the boys, "and we
are in them."</p>

<p>Then they heard a policeman shouting.
Looking up, they saw a singular spectacle.
Just in front of them was a poor old hearse
drawn by two horses, whose black trappings
touched the ground. Shabbier hearse never
was seen. Strangest of all, there was only
a little, thin, black-robed girl walking behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the hearse. There were no hired
mourners as usual. There was no large
group of friends walking with heads bared
in token of reverence; there was no priest;
no carriages followed after. Saddest of all,
there was not even a flower. What could
these things mean? How strange that
when they were so happy this little woman
could be so sad.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the soldier boys arose.
He stepped into the street and looked into
the hearse. There he saw these words: "A
soldier of France." He began to question
the woman. Lifting her veil, he saw a frail
girl, and while the traffic jam increased she
told her story. The soldier had been
wounded at the Battle of the Marne. He
was one of the first to be brought to Paris.
He never walked again. "I am very poor;
I have only one franc a day. We have no
friends. I borrowed money for the hearse."</p>

<p>The boy returned to his fellows. "Fall in
line, boys!" he shouted. "Here is a soldier
of France. This little girl has taken care of
him for three years on one franc a day.
Line up, everybody, and tell the men to
swallow their coffee and wine and fall into
the procession. Go into the shops and say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that a soldier of France lies here." When
that hearse began to move there were twenty
men and women walking as mourners behind
the body. Two soldier boys walked beside
the frail little girl with her heavy cr&ecirc;pe.
As the soldiers walked along beside the
hearse the procession began to grow. On
and on for two long miles this slowly moving
company increased in number until one
hundred were in line, and when they came
into God's Acre they buried the poor boy as
if he were a king coming in with trumpets
from the battle. For he was a soldier of
France.</p>


<h3>5. The Old Book-Lover of Louvain</h3>

<p>Among the fascinating pursuits of life we
must make a large place for the collection of
old books, old paintings, old missals and
curios. Certain cities, like Venice, Florence,
Rome, Naples, and Madrid, have been for
a thousand years like unto the Sargasso
Sea in which beautiful things have
drifted.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, men of leisure began to
collect these treasures. Some made their
way into Egypt and Palestine, and there uncovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
temples long buried in sands and
ruins and all covered with d&eacute;bris. From
time to time old missals were found in
deserted monasteries, marbles were digged
up in buried palaces. Men came back from
their journeys with some lovely terra cotta,
some ivory or bronze, some painting by an
old master, whose beauty had been hidden
for centuries under smoke and grime. The
enthusiasm of the collectors exceeds the zest
of men searching for gold and diamonds
amid the sands of South Africa.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago a young scholar of
Louvain won high praise because of his skill
in dating and naming old pictures and
manuscripts. When ten years had passed
by, this scholar's name and fame were spread
all over Europe. Many museums in different
countries competed for his services.</p>

<p>The time came when the heads of galleries
in London and Paris and Rome sent for this
expert to pass upon some art object. During
the fifty years this scholar came to know
every beautiful treasure in Europe.</p>

<p>In the old castles of Austria, in a monastery
of Bohemia, in the house of an ancient
Italian family, in certain second-hand bookstores,
in out-of-the-way towns he found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
treasures as precious as pearls and diamonds
raked out of the muck-heap.</p>

<p>When death took away his only son and
left his little grandchildren dependent upon
himself the old book-lover looked forward
serenely into the future. He knew that
every year his treasures were growing more
and more valuable. Living in his home in
Louvain he received from time to time visits
from experts, who came in from all the
cities of the world to see his treasures, and
if possible, to buy some rare book.</p>

<p>Then, in August, 1914, came the great catastrophe,
as came the explosion of Vesuvius
that buried Pompeii under hot ashes and
flaming fire.</p>

<p>One morning the old scholar was startled
by the noise and confusion in the street.
Looking down from his window he saw
German soldiers, German horsemen, German
cannon. He beheld women and children
lined up on the sidewalk. He saw
German soldiers assault old men. He saw
them carrying the furniture, rugs and carpets
out of the houses. He saw the flames
coming out of the roofs of houses a block
away.</p>

<p>A moment later an old university professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pounded upon his door and called out
that they must flee for their lives. There
was only time to pick out one satchel and
fill it with his precious manuscripts and
costly missals. Then the two old scholars
fled into the street with the grandchildren.
Fortunately a Belgian driving a two-wheeled
coal cart was passing by. Into the cart
climbed the little grandchildren. Carefully
the satchel filled with its treasures was also
lifted into place.</p>

<p>At that moment a German shell exploded
beside the cart. When the old book-lover
recovered consciousness the cart was gone,
the grandchildren were dead and of all his
art treasures there was left only one little
book upon which some scholar of the twelfth
century had toiled with loving hands.</p>

<p>Carried forward among the refugees several
hours later, Belgian soldiers lifted the old
man into a train that was carrying the
wounded down to Havre. In his hand the
collector held the precious book. Excitement
and sorrow had broken his heart. His
mind also wandered. He was no longer
able to understand the cosmic terror and
blackness. A noble officer, himself wounded,
put his coat under the old man's head and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
made a pillow and bade him forget the German
beast, the bomb shells, the blazing city.
But all these foul deeds and all dangers now
were as naught to the old man.</p>

<p>"See my little book," he said. "How
beautiful the lettering! Why, upon this
book, as upon a ship, civilization sailed
across the dark waters of the Middle Ages.
Look at this book of beauty. The ugliness
of the tenth century is dead. The cruelty
and the slavery of bloody tyrants is dead
also. The old cannon are quite rusted away.
But look at this! Behold, its beauty is
immortal! Everything else dies. Soon all
the smoke and blood will go, but beauty and
love and liberty will remain."</p>

<p>And then lifting the little book the old
collector of Louvain pressed his lips to the
vellum page, bright with the blue and crimson
and gold of seven hundred years, and in
a moment passed to the soul's summer land,
where no shriek of German shells rends the
air, where wicked Germans have ceased from
troubling and where the French and Belgians,
worn by the cruelty of the Huns, are
now at rest and peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h3>6. A Vision of Judgment in Martyred
Gerb&eacute;viller</h3>

<p>To-day everybody knows the story of
Gerb&eacute;viller, the martyred.</p>

<p>To the northwest is that glorious capital
of Lorraine, Nancy. Farther northwest are
Verdun and Toul, with our American boys.
The region round about the martyred town
is a region of rich iron ores.</p>

<p>Some years ago, Germany found herself
at bay, by reason of the threatened exhaustion
of her iron mines in Alsace-Lorraine.
The news that France had uncovered new
beds of iron ore stirred Germany to a frenzy
of envy and longing.</p>

<p>High grade iron ore meant a new financial
era for France. The exhaustion of Germany's
iron mines meant industrial depression,
and finally a second and third rate
position. Rather than lose her place Germany
determined to go to war with France
and Belgium and grab their iron mines. To
break down resistance on the part of the
French people, the Germans used atrocities
that were fiendish beyond words. The
richer the province she wished to steal, the
more terrible her cruelties.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>At nine o'clock in the morning on August
27, General Clauss and 15,000 soldiers entered
Gerb&eacute;viller. Ten miles to the south
was the remainder of the German army,
utterly broken by the French attack. Clauss
had been sent north to dig his trenches until
the rest of the German army could retreat.</p>

<p>Every hour was precious. The Germans
remained in the little town from 9 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> until
12:30 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> They found in the village
thirty-one hundred women, girls and children,
fifteen old men (the eldest ninety-two),
one priest and one Red Cross ambulance
driver. Even the little boys and men under
seventy had gone to the front to dig ditches
and carry water to the French.</p>

<p>It took the Germans only two and one-half
hours to loot all the houses and load
upon their trucks the rugs, carpets, chairs,
pictures, bedding, with every knife and fork
and plate. At half-past eleven General
Clauss was in the Mayor's house, when the
German colonel came in and reported that
everything in the houses had been stripped
and that they were ready to begin the firing
of the buildings.</p>

<p>The aged wife of the secretary to the
Mayor told me this incident:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"We find no weapons in the houses, and
we find only these fifteen old men, one Red
Cross boy, and this priest," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"Line up the old men then and shoot
them," shouted General Clauss. "Take the
priest as a prisoner to do work in the
trenches."</p>

<p>The old men were lined up on the grass.
General Clauss himself gave the signal to
fire. Two German soldiers fired bullets into
each one of the old men.</p>

<p>One of the heart-broken onlookers was the
village priest. The Germans carried him
away as prisoner and made him work as a
common labourer; through rain and sun,
through heat and snow, he toiled on, digging
ditches, carrying burdens, working eighteen
hours a day, eating spoiled food that the
German soldiers would not touch, until
finally tuberculosis developed and he was
sick unto death. Then the Germans released
him as a refugee, so the priest returned to
Gerb&eacute;viller to die.</p>

<p>Then came the anniversary of the murder
of the fifteen old men and of the one hundred
and two women, girls and children.
On the anniversary day of the martyrdom
the noble Governor of the province assembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the few survivors for a memorial
service about the graves of the martyrs.</p>

<p>Knowing that the priest would never see
another anniversary of that day the Prefect
asked the priest to give the address at the
memorial service. No more dramatic scene
ever occurred in history. At the beginning
the priest told the story of the coming of
the Germans, the looting of the houses, the
violation of the little girls, the collecting of
the dead bodies. Suddenly the priest closed
his eyes, and all unconsciously he lived the
scene of those three and a half hours.</p>

<p>"I see our fifteen heroes standing on the
grass. I see the German soldiers lifting up
their rifles. I hear General Clauss cursing
and shouting the command to fire.</p>

<p>"I see you, Thomas; a brutal soldier tears
your coat back. He puts his rifle against
your heart. When you sink down I see
your hands come together in prayer.</p>

<p>"I see you, Fran&ccedil;ois. I see the two big
crutches on which you lean. You are weary
with the load of ninety years. I hear your
granddaughter when she sobs your name,
and I see your smile, as you strive to encourage
her.</p>

<p>"I see you, Jean. How happy you were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
when you came back with your wealth to
spend your last years in your native town!
How kind you were to all our poor. Ah!
Jean, you did us good and not evil, all the
days of your life with us!</p>

<p>"I see you, little Marie. You were lying
upon the grass. I see your two little hands
tied by ropes to the two peach trees in your
mother's garden. I see the little wisp of
black hair stretched out under your head. I
see your little body lying dead. With this
hand of mine upon that little board, above
your grave, I wrote the words, 'Vengeance
is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.'</p>

<p>"And yonder in the clouds I see the Son
of Man coming in His glory with His angels.
I see the Kaiser falling upon Gerb&eacute;viller. I
see Clauss falling upon our aged Mayor.
But I also see God arising to fall upon the
Germans. Berlin, with Babylon the Great,
is fallen. It has become a nest of unclean
things. There serpents dwell. Woe unto
them that offend against my little ones. For,
lo, a millstone is hanged about their necks
and they shall be drowned in the sea with
Satan."</p>

<p>The excitement was too much for the
priest. That very night he died. Henceforth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
he will be numbered among the martyrs
of Gerb&eacute;viller.</p>


<h3>7. The Return of the Refugees</h3>

<p>The return of the refugees to Belgium
and France holds the essence of a thousand
tragedies. From the days of Homer down
to those of Longfellow, with his story of
Evangeline, literature has recounted the sad
lot of lovers torn from one another's arms
and all the rest of their lives going every
whither in search of the beloved one, only to
find the lost and loved when it was too late.</p>

<p>But nothing in literature is so tragic as
the events now going on from week to week
in the towns on the frontier of Switzerland.</p>

<p>When the Germans raped Belgium and
northern France they sent back to the rear
trenches the young women and the girls,
and now, from time to time, those girls, all
broken in health, are released by the Germans,
who send them back to their parents
or husbands.</p>

<p>Multitudes of these girls have died of
abuse and cruelty, but others, broken in
body and spirit, are returning for an interval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that is brief and heart-breaking before the
end comes.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago an old friend returned
from his Red Cross work in France. By invitation
of a Government official he visited
a town on the frontier through which the
refugees released by Germany were returning
to France.</p>

<p>It seemed that during the month of September,
1914, the Germans had carried away
a number of girls and young women in a
village northeast of Lun&eacute;ville. When the
French officials finished their inquiry as to
the poor, broken creatures returning to
France they found a French woman, clothed
in rags, emaciated and sick unto death. In
her arms she held a little babe a few weeks
old. Its tiny wrists were scarcely larger
than lead pencils. The child moaned incessantly.
The mother was too thin and weak
to do more than answer the simple questions
as to her name, age, parents, and husband.</p>

<p>Moved with the sense of compassion, the
French official soon found in his index the
name of her husband, the number of his
company and telegraphed to the young soldier's
superior officer, asking that the boy
might be sent forward to the receiving station<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to take his wife back to some friend,
since the Germans had destroyed his village.
By some unfortunate blunder the officials
gave no hint of the real facts in the case.</p>

<p>Filled with high hope, burning with enthusiasm,
exhaling a happiness that cannot
be described, the bronzed farmer-soldier
stepped down from the car to find the
French official waiting to conduct him to
one of the houses of refuge where his young
wife was waiting.</p>

<p>My American Red Cross friend witnessed
the meeting between the girl and her husband.
When the fine young soldier entered
the room he saw a poor, broken, spent, miserable
creature, too weak to do more than
whisper his name. When the young man
saw that tiny German babe in his young
wife's arms he started as if he had been
stung by a scorpion. Lifting his hands
above his head, he uttered an exclamation
of horror. In utter amazement he started
back, overwhelmed with revulsion, anguish
and terror.</p>

<p>Gone&mdash;the beauty and comeliness of the
young wife! Gone her health and allurement!
Perished all her loveliness! Her
garments were the garments of a scarecrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Despite all these things the girl was innocent.
But she realized her husband's horror
and mistook it for disgust. She pitched forward
unconscious upon the floor before her
husband could reach her.</p>

<p>The history of pain contains no more terrible
chapter. That night the dying girl
told the French officials and her husband the
crimes and indignities to which she had been
subjected. Two other babes had been born
under German brutality, and both had died,
even as this infant would die, and when a
few days later her husband buried her he was
another man. The iron in him had become
steel. The blade of intellect had become a
two-edged sword. His strength had become
the strength of ten. He decided not to survive
this war. Going back to the front, he
consecrated his every day to one task&mdash;to
kill Germans and save other women from
the foulest degenerates that have ever cursed
the face of the earth.</p>


<h3>8. An American Knight in France</h3>

<p>Coming around the corner of the street in
a little French village near Toul, I beheld an
incident that explained the all but adoring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
love given to our American boys by the
French children. The women and the girls
of that region had suffered unspeakable
things at the hands of the German swine.
Photographs were taken of the dead bodies
of girls that can never be shown. The terror
of the women at the very approach of the
German was beyond all words. The very
words "Les Boches" send the blood from
the cheeks of the children. The women of
the Dakotas on hearing that the Sioux
Indians were on the war-path with their
scalping knives were never so terrified as
the French girls are on hearing the German
soldiers are on the march. Even the little
children have black rings under their eyes,
with a strained, tense expression as they
stand tremulous and ready to run.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk near me was a little
French girl of about six, with her little
brother, perhaps four years of age. Suddenly
around the corner came an American
boy in khaki. He was swinging forward
with step sure and alert. The children
turned, but there was no terror in their eyes
and no fear in their hearts. They did not
know the American soldier; never before
had they seen his face, but his khaki meant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
safety. It meant a shield lifted between the
German monster and themselves. Forgetting
everything, the little French girl started on
a run towards the American soldier, while
her little brother came hobbling after. She
ran straight to the American boy, flung her
arms around his legging, rubbed her cheek
against his trousers and patted his knee with
her little hands. A moment later when her
little brother came up the American boy
stooped down, lifted the boy and girl into
his arms, and while they were screaming
with delight carried them across to a little
shop, and found for them two tiny little
cakes of chocolate, the only sweet that
could be had. The French children understand.</p>

<p>The German motto was: "Frightfulness
and terrorism are the very essence of our
new warfare."</p>

<p>Pershing's charge was: "You will protect
all property, safeguard all lives, lift a shield
above the aged, be most courteous to the
women, most tender and gentle to the children."</p>

<p>In France our boys have lifted a shield
above the poor and the weak, and, having
given service, they are receiving a degree of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
love beyond measure; but there is no danger
that they will be spoiled by the adulation of
the French women and children, who rank
them with the knights and the heroes of old.</p>


<h3>9. An American Soldier's Grave in France</h3>

<p>One August morning I was in the wheat
fields near Roye. Somewhere in that field
the body of a noble American boy was lying.
He was a graduate of the University of
Virginia; his mother and his sister had a
host of friends in my old home city, Chicago.
Guided by a white-haired priest, out in the
wheat we found at last a little mound with a
part of a broken airplane lying thereupon.
I pulled the rest of his machine upon his
grave and learned that when the French
boys picked him up they found that four
explosive bullets had struck him while flying
in the air after his victory over many German
enemies.</p>

<p>With my knife I cut a sheaf of golden
grain and an armful of scarlet poppies and
said a prayer for the boy and his mother and
his sister.</p>

<p>Standing there in the rain I wrote a letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to those who loved him, saying: "When you
see this head of wheat, say to yourself 'One
grain going into the ground shall in fifteen
summers ripen into bread enough to feed
sixteen hundred millions of the family of
men.' When you look at this pressed poppy,
say, 'His blood like red rain went to the
root to make the flowers crimson and beautiful
for all the world; soon the fields of
France shall wave like a Garden of God,
and peace and plenty shall dwell forever
there. "Without shedding of blood there is
no remission." Wine means the crushing of
the grapes. At great price our fathers
bought Liberty.'"</p>

<p>Two thousand years ago Cicero, sobbing
above the dead body of his daughter Tullia,
exclaimed: "Is there a meeting place for
the dead?" What becomes of our soldier
boys who died on the threshold of life?
This is life's hardest problem. Where is
that young Tullia so dear to that gifted
Roman orator? Where is that young
musician Mozart? Where is young Keats?
And where is Shelley? And where are
young McConnell and Rupert Brooke and
young Asquith? And ten thousand more
of those young men with genius. Where also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
is that young Carpenter of Nazareth, dead at
thirty years of age?</p>

<p>The answer is in this: They have passed
through the black waters and have come
into the summer land. There they have
been met by the heroes coming out with
trumpets and banners to bring them into a
world unstained by the smoke and din of
battle. There they will write their books,
invent their tools, complete their songs and
guide the darkling multitudes who come in out
of Africa, out of the islands of the sea, into the
realm of perfect knowledge, love and peace.</p>


<h3>10. "These Flowers, Sir, I Will Lay
Them Upon My Son's Grave"</h3>

<p>Last August, at an assembly in Paris,
Ambassador Sharp held a little company
spellbound, while he related several incidents
of his investigations in the devastated region
near Roye. One afternoon the captain
stopped his military automobile upon the
edge of what had once been a village. Surveyors
were tracing the road and making
measurements in the hope of establishing the
former location of the cellar and the house
that stood above it. An old gray-haired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Frenchman had the matter in charge. He
had lost the cellar of his house. Also, the
trees that had stood upon his front sidewalk,
also his vines and fruit trees. His story as
stated by Ambassador Sharp was most
pathetic. The old man had retired from
business to the little town of his childhood.
When it became certain that the Germans
would take the village, the man pried up a
stone slab in the sidewalk and buried his
money, far out of sight. A long time passed
by. When the Hindenburg plans were
completed, the Germans made their retreat.
Among other refugees who returned was
the aged Frenchman. To his unbounded
amazement the old man could not locate the
site of his old home. In bombarding the
little village, the Germans dropped huge
shells. These shells fell into the cellar, and
blew the brick walls away. Other shells fell
in the front yard, and blew the trees out by
the roots. Later other shells exploding blew
dirt back into the other excavations. Little
by little, the ground was turned into a mass
of mud. Not a single landmark remained.
Finally the old man conceived the idea of
beginning back on the country road, and
measuring what he thought would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the distance to his garden. But even that
device failed him. For the huge shells had
blown the stone slab into atoms, scattered
his buried treasure, and left the man in his
old age penniless and heart-broken.</p>

<p>Long ago Dumas represented the man
who had taken too much wine as trying in
vain to enter his own home, explaining to
his inebriated friend that the keyhole was
lost. But think of a cellar that is lost!
Think of shade trees, whose very roots have
disappeared! Think of a lovely little French
garden with its roses and vines, and fruit
trees, all gone! "Why, the very well was
with difficulty located," said the Ambassador.
But after all, the loss of buried treasure
that could never be found is only a
faint emblem of the loss of human bodies
and human minds. Think of the soldiers
who have returned to find that the young
wife or daughter whom they loved has disappeared
forever! And think of the wives
and sweethearts who have received word
from their officers that the great shell exploded
and killed the lover, but that no
fragment of his body could be found!
During one day Mr. Chamberlain and myself
were driven through twenty-four series<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of ruins, that once had been towns and villages,
but where there was nothing left but
cellars filled with twisted iron and blackened
rafters. Already, men are anticipating the
hour of victory and talking about the reconstruction
of the devastated regions, the enforced
service of a million German factories,
building up what once they had torn
down. But the restoring of houses, the
restoration of factory and schoolhouse, of
church and gallery, represent a material recovery.
But the other day, a French woman
was invited before the general who decorated
the widow and praised her, returning to
her the thanks of France, in that her last and
seventh son had just been killed. Her response
was one of the most moving things in
history. "I have given France my all.
These flowers, ah, sir, I have but one use for
them. I will take them out, and lay them
on my son's grave."</p>


<h3>11. The Courage of Clemenceau</h3>

<p>One Sunday afternoon, last August, in
Paris, Alexandre, head of the Fine Arts Department
of the Government, brought me
an invitation from Rodin to visit his studio.
We found the successor to Michael Angelo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
turning over in his hand an exquisite little
head of Minerva, goddess of wisdom, carved
with the perfection of a lily or a rose. "He
is always studying something," exclaimed
the author. But what Rodin wanted us to
see was his head of Clemenceau. When the
covering was lifted, there stood the very
embodiment of the man who is supreme in
France to-day,&mdash;Clemenceau. The sculptor's
face kindled and lighted up. "The
lion of France!" How massive the features!
How glorious the neck and the
shoulders! Clemenceau makes me think of
a stag, holding the wolves at bay, while his
herd finds safety in flight. He makes me
think of the lion, roaring in defence of his
whelps. Our descendants will say, of a
truth there were giants in those days, and
among the giants we must make a large
place for Clemenceau.</p>

<p>The invincible courage of Clemenceau is in
the challenge he has just flung out to the
enemies of France. Reduced to simple
terms it comes to this,&mdash;"It is said that the
Germans can get within bombing distance of
Paris, or reach the capital, providing they
are willing to pay the price. Well,&mdash;the
Allies can break through the German line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and gain the Rhine, providing they are
willing to pay the price. To destroy Paris
means a price of 750,000 Germans at least.
The probabilities are that so heavy a price
would mean a political revolution in Germany.
But what if Ludendorff gets to Paris?
Rome was twice destroyed, and later the
city of brick was rebuilt as a city of marble.
Nearly fifty years ago the people of Paris
destroyed their own city, at an expense of
hundreds of millions of francs. The motive
back of the destruction was the desire to replace
an old and ugly city by a new and the
most beautiful city in the world. Fire destroyed
Chicago, intellect rebuilt it,&mdash;earthquake
and flame levelled San Francisco,
courage restored the ruins. Enemies may
destroy Paris, genius and French art and
skill and industry and will, will replace it.
Our eyes are fixed on the goal, namely, the
crushing of Prussianism. What if Paris
must decrease? It will only mean that
civilization in France, and humanity, will increase."
Reduced to the simplest terms, that
is the substance of Clemenceau's appeal.
Never was there courage more wonderful.
Not even Leonidas at Thermopyl&aelig; ever
breathed nobler sentiments. That is why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Paris is safe to-day. That is why France is
secure. That is why we await with confidence
and quietness the next great offensive
for the Germans.</p>

<p>In her darkest hour what France and the
world needed was a hero, a man of oak and
rock, a great heart, a lion,&mdash;and the world
found such a man in Clemenceau. Nothing
fascinates the listeners like tales of courage.
Not even stories of love and eloquence have
such a charm for children and youth. Many
of us remember that in our childhood the
crippled soldier of the Civil War became a
living college, teaching bravery to the boys
of the little town. For months Clemenceau
has been going up and down France, heartening
the people. This Prime Minister with
his great massive head, the roaring voice,
the clenched fist, is an exhilarating spectacle.
That hero of Switzerland, William Tell, left
behind him a tradition that it meant much
to him to waken each morning and find
Mont Blanc standing firm in its place. Not
otherwise all patriots, soldiers, and lovers of
their fellow men to-day can look on the great
French statesman and patriot and gather
comfort and courage from the fact that he
still stands firmly in his place.</p>

<h3>1. "Gott Strafe England"&mdash;"and Scotland"</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">At</span> the crossroads near the city of Ypres
is a sign-board giving the directions
and the distances to various towns. One
day the Germans captured that highway.</p>

<p>There was a man in the company who
had lived in some German-American city
of the United States. He knew that but
for England Germany would have gotten
through to the Channel towns and looted
Paris. Climbing up on the sign-board that
German-American wrote in good plain English
these words: "God &mdash;&mdash; England!"</p>

<p>That afternoon the Australian and the New
Zealand army pushed the Germans back and
recaptured the highway. Among other soldiers
was a Scotsman named Sandy.</p>

<p>He read the sign, "God &mdash;&mdash; England!"
with ever increasing anger. Finally he flung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his arms and legs around the sign-post, pulled
himself up to the top and, while his companions
watched him, they saw him do a
most amazing thing.</p>

<p>They were cheering him because they expected
him to rub out the word "England."
But not Sandy! Holding on by his left
hand, with his right Sandy added to the
words "God &mdash;&mdash; England!" these words,
"and Scotland."</p>

<p>He felt that it was an outrage that Scotland
should be overlooked in any good thing.
Blessed was the people who had won the
distinction of being hated by the German,
and therefore Sandy added the words "and
Scotland"!</p>

<p>Now Scotland deserved that high praise.
When the historian comes to write the full
story of this great war it will make a large
place for the words "and Scotland." Wonderful
the heroism of the British army!
Marvellous their achievements! But who is
at the head of it? A great Scotsman, Sir
Douglas Haig.</p>

<p>What stories fill the pages of the achievements
of English sailors ever since the days
of Nelson, standing on the deck of the <i>Victory</i>,
down to the battle of Jutland! But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that gallant Scot, Admiral Beatty, holds the
centre of the stage to-day. There came a
critical moment also when a man of intellect
and a great heart must represent Great
Britain in her greatest crisis in the United
States, and in that hour they sent a Scotsman,
Arthur James Balfour, philosopher,
metaphysician, theologian, statesman, diplomat
and seer.</p>

<p>And what shall one more say save that
the finances of this war have been controlled
by a Scotch Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and her railways organized by a Scotch inventor.
Wonderful the achievements of
England&mdash;that "dear, dear land." Marvellous
the contribution of Wales, through men
like the Prime Minister, Lloyd George!</p>

<p>Who can praise sufficiently the heroes of
Canada, Australia and New Zealand? In
Ireland, for the moment, things are in a
muddle. "What is the trouble with the
Emerald Isle?" was the question, to which
the Irishman made instant reply: "Oh, in
South Ireland we are all Roman Catholics,
and in North Ireland we are all Protestants,
and I wish to heaven we were all agnostics,
and then we could live together like
Christians."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>But Ireland will soon iron out her troubles.
To the achievements of the various people of
the great British Empire let us make a large
place for the contributions of Scotland. The
Germans hate with a deadly hatred any
country and any race that has stopped them
in their headlong career towards crime.</p>

<p>But the next time that a German-American
has gone back to Berlin and has reached the
western front and puts up a sign reading
"Gott strafe England" let him not fail to
add these words, "and Scotland."</p>


<h3>2. "England Shall Not Starve"</h3>

<p>Despite all warnings, rumours, and alarms,
no dire peril known to passengers disturbed
our voyage. The nearest approach came on
a morning when the ship was two hundred
miles off the coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>The steamer was making a letter S and
constantly zigzagging, when suddenly the
lookout called down that there was a rowboat
dead ahead. With instant decision the
officer changed the ship's course and we
passed the life-boat a half mile upon our
right.</p>

<p>The usual rumour started up and down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the deck that there were dead bodies in the
boat, but the petty officer answered my
question by saying that it was 2,000 lives
against one possible life that every drifting
boat must be looked upon as a German
decoy; that if the steamer stopped to send
sailors with a life-boat to investigate it would
simply give a German submarine a chance to
come up with torpedoes. At that very moment
one of the men beside the gun sighted
a periscope and a moment later the gun
roared and then boomed a second time and
then a third. Because the object disappeared,
all passengers said it was a submarine,
but the officers said it was a piece
of driftwood, tossed up on the crest of a
wave.</p>

<p>That night, on deck, a close friend of the
purser came for an hour's walk around the
deck. The memory of those three shots
rested heavily upon his mind.</p>

<p>It seemed that some months before he had
been a purser on an East Indian liner. On
the home voyage, twenty-four hours after
they left Cairo, when well out into the
Mediterranean, this officer went below for
an hour's rest. Suddenly a torpedo struck
the steamer. The force of the explosion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
literally blew the purser out of his berth.
Grabbing some clothes, he ran through the
narrow passageway, already ankle deep in
rushing water. The great ship carried
several thousand soldiers and a few women
who were coming home from India or from
Egypt. Despite the fact that all realized the
steamer would go down within a few minutes,
there was no confusion and the soldiers
lined up as if on parade.</p>

<p>The boat went down in about eight minutes,
but every one of the women and children
had on their life-preservers and were
given first places in the life-boats that had
not been ruined by the explosion.</p>

<p>The purser said that he decided to jump
from the deck and swim as far as possible
from the steamer, but despite his struggles
he was drawn under and came up half unconscious
to find himself surrounded with
swimming men and sinking rowboats that
were being shelled by the German submarine.
Suddenly a machine-gun bullet
passed through his right shoulder and left
an arm helpless. For half an hour he lay
with his left arm upon a floating board, held
up by his life-preserver. The submarine had
disappeared. At distances far removed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
were three of the ship's boats and one raft.
It was plain that there was no help in
sight.</p>

<p>Near him was a woman, to whom he
called. The purser told the woman that he
had been shot in the right arm and could not
help her nor come near to her. She answered
that it was good to hear his voice.</p>

<p>The water was very cold. He began to
be alarmed and reasoned as to whether the
cold water would not stay the bleeding.
From time to time he would call out to the
woman to keep up hope and courage and not
to struggle, but at last he saw she was exhausted.
With infinite effort, swimming
with his left arm, he managed to draw near
to her.</p>

<p>"Is drowning very painful?" the woman
asked.</p>

<p>"No," answered the officer. "Once the
water rushes into the lungs one smothers."</p>

<p>To which the English girl answered,
"Then I think I will not wait any longer.
Good-bye! Good luck!"</p>

<p>Utterly exhausted she let her head fall
over and in a moment the life-preserver was
on the top and that was all that he saw.</p>

<p>"The next thing I remember," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
officer, "was waking up to find a nurse trying
to pour a stimulant down my throat."</p>

<p>A destroyer had come up in response to
the signals for help and picked up the
survivors.</p>

<p>For months he was in the hospital before
he could be carried to England. Even now
he was not able to lift a hat from his head
with his right arm, but he could write a little.
This was his first voyage to test his strength
to prove to the Government that he could
take his old task as purser.</p>

<p>"How did you feel, purser, when you
heard that cannon roar this morning against
that submarine?"</p>

<p>You should have seen the fire flash in the
man's eyes.</p>

<p>"How did I feel?" answered the officer.
"I felt like a race-horse snuffing the battle
from afar. Let them sink this ship&mdash;I will
take another. Let them sink every steamer,
I'll take a sailing vessel. Let them sink all
our sailing vessels, we will betake ourselves
to tugs.</p>

<p>"We have 5,000 steamers that come and
go between any Sunday and Sunday. Some
are old cattle-boats, some are sea tramps and
some are ocean hounds. They have carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
10,000,000 men and 20,000,000 tons of war
materials, and 8,000,000 tons of iron ore and
$3,000,000,000 worth of goods.</p>

<p>"We have lent six hundred ships to
France and four hundred ships to Italy.
Our ancestors smashed the Spanish Armada.
Our grandfathers baffled Napoleon and their
sons defy the Hun and his submarine.</p>

<p>"When I go down my son will take my
place. When Germany beats England there
will not be an Englishman left to tell how it
happened."</p>

<p>Then, leaning over the railing of the ship,
the officer pointed to the setting sun, and lo,
right out of the sea, sailing into our sight,
came a fleet of English merchantmen, laden
with wheat, and the purser said:</p>

<p>"By God's help, England shall not
starve."</p>


<h3>3. German-Americans Who Vilify England</h3>

<p>The biography of Grant holds many exciting
incidents. One of them concerns a spy
who nearly wrecked Grant's plans. It seems
that a rumour came saying that Sheridan
had been defeated at Winchester. A telegram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
came a few minutes later saying that
Sheridan was recovering from the disaster.
Meanwhile, Grant noticed one of his young
assistants was endeavouring in vain to conceal
his pleasure over the news of Sheridan's
defeat. That feeling seemed inexplicable to
Grant. The Commander-in-Chief had three
armies&mdash;Sherman's in the South, Sheridan's
in the Valley of the Shenandoah, and his
own army of the Potomac. How could a
young aide rejoice over Sheridan's defeat
without down in his heart wanting Grant
defeated, the Union destroyed, and secession
made a success? Grant became more and
more alarmed. He told one of his associates
to follow this youth, whom he feared was a
spy. Shortly afterwards the man was discovered
sending signals, was tried, the proofs
of his treason uncovered, and finally he was
executed.</p>

<p>To-day certain German-Americans never
tire of announcing their Americanism. Their
favourite expression is: "Germany was the
Fatherland, but the United States is the
wife." Not daring, therefore, to attack our
Government, afraid to confess that they want
Germany to succeed, and when that time
comes expect to hold certain offices under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Germany, they spend all their time vilifying
Great Britain. There is one absolute and
invariable test of the German-American's
treason to this country, and that is bitterness
towards England, because England is
doing all she can to prevent Germany's victory.
One thing has saved this country
during four years, giving us a chance to
prepare&mdash;Great Britain's fleet, holding Germany's
battle-ships behind the Kiel Canal.
To-day our Republic is defended by three
armies&mdash;General Pershing's, Marshal Foch's
and Marshal Haig's. But whenever a German-American
vilifies Haig and attacks England
you may know that down in his heart
he wants Pershing defeated, the United
States conquered, and Germany made victorious.
The German-American who vilifies
Great Britain is angry because Great Britain
has prevented Germany from loading a million
German veterans upon her six or eight
thousand passenger ships, freight ships, sailing
vessels and war fleet, and sailing to New
York and assessing fifty billion dollars indemnity
upon us.</p>

<p>In a certain Western State a German professor
of electricity resigned from his institution.
He was receiving about $3,000 a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
year. Many months passed by. One day
this man was heard defaming England.
"England has destroyed the freedom of the
seas. England controls Gibraltar and the
Suez Canal. England is the great land
pirate. England is the world butcher." A
Secret Service man followed the German
professor, and found that he was working as
fireman at the wireless station of that great
city. This German professor of electricity
had resigned a $3,000 a year position to
work for $75 a month as fireman. As soon
as he found that the United States Government
was upon his track he fled to Mexico.
This spy's camouflage was love for the United
States, but his treason was revealed through
his hatred of England. That man should
have been arrested at dark, tried at midnight,
and shot at daybreak.</p>

<p>There is a newspaper reporter in this country.
This German-American was caught by
a trick. Another reporter faked a story,
writing out on his typewriter an account
of several German submarines getting into
the harbour of Liverpool and blowing up
half a dozen English steamers and killing
several thousand Englishmen, and this German-American
reporter lifted his hands into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the air in glee, and in the presence of half a
dozen fellow reporters shouted: "I knew it!
I knew it! I knew the Germans would
smash Hades out of them!" In that moment
he revealed his real attitude towards
the United States. Any man that wants
Admiral Beatty defeated wants the American
transports sunk and American soldiers
murdered. That reporter should also have
been arrested at dark, tried at midnight, and
shot at daybreak.</p>

<p>In another city there is a young Irish
writer. He fulfills all the proverbs about
the crazy Irishman. In connection with the
Sinn Fein conspiracy this young writer proposed
a toast to the memory of Sir Roger
Casement, the success of the revolution, and
poured forth such bitterness upon England
as cannot be described by those who hate
ingratitude towards a country that has given
us a chance to prepare. Wherever that man
goes he carries hate with him towards Great
Britain. His atmosphere is malign; his
presence breathes treason towards England.
That is another man who should have been
arrested at dark, tried at midnight, and shot
at daybreak. No man can serve God and
Mammon. No man can be faithful to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
United States who hates England and loves
Germany. He must love the one and hate
the other; he must hold to the one and despise
the crimes of the other. No man can
serve God and the Allies, Germany and the
devil, at one and the same time.</p>


<h3>4. British vs. American Girls in Munition
Factories</h3>

<p>To-morrow morning at eight o'clock one
million British girls will enter the munition
and related factories. To-morrow afternoon
at four o'clock another million girls will
enter the same factories, to be followed at
midnight by the third shift of women.</p>

<p>These factories average forty feet wide,
and end to end would be 100 feet in length.
The roar of the machinery is never silent by
day or night.</p>

<p>In one factory I saw a young woman who
was closely related, through her grandfather,
to a man in the House of Lords. Her arms
were black with machine oil, her hair was
under a rubber cover, she wore bloomers.
Her task was pouring two tons of molten
steel into the shell moulds. The great shells
passed from the hands of one girl to another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
until the fiftieth girl, 1,500 feet away, finished
the threads into which the cap's screw
was fastened.</p>

<p>Every twenty-four hours these women
turn out more small calibre cartridges than
all England did the first year of this war.
Every forty-eight hours they turn out more
large cartridges than all England did the
first year of this war. Every six days, with
the help of men not fit for the battle front,
they turn out more heavy cannon than all
England did the first year of this war.</p>

<p>They have sent 17,000,900 tons of ammunition
to the front. Their shells are roaring
on five battle fronts in three continents.
When the British boys thrust their huge
shells into the cannon these boys literally receive
the shells at the hands of the millions of
English girls who are passing them forward.</p>

<p>Wonderful the heroism of the British soldiers!
The reason why the men fight well
at the front is because there are women at
home worth fighting for. In all ages battles
have been won, partly by the strong arm of
the soldier, but chiefly by the heart that
nerves the arm. That is why John Ruskin
once said that "the woman in the rear generally
wins the victory at the front."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>It stirs one's sense of wonder to find that
all classes and all social conditions are represented
in these factories. Thousands of
young school-teachers have left the schoolroom
behind, closed the book and desk and
gone to the factory. Tens of thousands of
young wives and mothers have left their
little children with the grandmother. Many
rectors and clergymen and priests, unfit for
service at the front by reason of age, work
all day long in the munition factory. Many
a professional man crowds his work in the
office that he may reach the factory for at
least a few hours' work upon shot and shell.</p>

<p>One day in France, as I was entering the
factory, I saw perhaps twenty young women
come out, hurry across the street to a building
where two old crippled soldiers were
taking care of the little children. These
young mothers nursed their babes, looked
after the other children and then hurried
back to the factory. Every minute was
precious; every day was big with destiny.
Their young husbands and brothers and
lovers, when the German push came, must
have their cartridges and shells ready and in
abundance.</p>

<p>Watching these women with their strained,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
anxious faces&mdash;women who cut each thread
in the shell with the accuracy of the expert&mdash;you
could see the lips of the woman murmuring,
and needed no confession from her
that she was silently praying for the man
who would use this weapon to defend her
beloved France, her aged mother and her
little child.</p>

<p>When the beast is slain and the Potsdam
gang tried and executed for their crimes,
and the boys come home with trumpets and
banners, the ovations will be for the soldiers;
but after the soldiers have had their
parade and their honour and their ovation
on the first day of the triumph, there should
be a second great parade, in which, while
the soldiers stand on the streets and observe,
and the merchants and working men and the
professional classes stand as spectators, down
the street shall march the munition girls,
who fashioned the weapons with which the
soldiers slew the common enemy.</p>

<p>For while the boys at the front have defended
liberty the girls at home have armed
the soldiers. Neither one without the other
could have made the world safe for democracy.</p>

<p>Through the imagination these women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
have a right, while they toil, to watch the
shell complete their work. The smith who
forges the chain for the ship's anchor has a
right to exult when he looks out through his
imagination upon the great boat held firm by
his chain in the hour when the storm threatened
to hurl the craft upon the rocks. The
inventor has a right to say: "That granary
full of wheat is mine; I invented the
reaper." The physician has a right to rejoice
over the battle and victory over the
youth whose life was saved by the surgeon's
skill. Not otherwise, the munition girl has
a right when the long day of battle is over
to say: "I safeguarded that cottage; I
lifted a shield above that little child; I
built a wall against the cathedral and the
gallery and the homes of yonder city."</p>

<p>For American girls of vision there is nothing
that they so much desire as the immediate
condemnation by our Government
of 10,000 luxury-producing plants in this
country, which should immediately be taken
over by our Government for munition purposes,
and before the daybreak of the first
morning there would be ten million American
girls standing before the doors, trying to
break their way in to obtain a chance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
fashion the shells that would protect American
boys in danger at the front.</p>


<h3>5. The Wolves' Den on Vimy Ridge</h3>

<p>The bloodiest battle of 1917 was fought
on the slopes of Vimy Ridge. That ridge is
seven and a half miles long and is shaped
like a dog's hind leg. Lifted up to an elevation
of several hundred feet, the hill not
only commands an outlook upon the German
lines eastward, but protects the great plains
that slope westward towards the English
Channel.</p>

<p>To hold that ridge the Germans constructed
a vast system of trenches, barbed
wire barriers, Portland cement pill-boxes
and underneath the ridge, at a depth of sixty
feet, they made their prisoners dig a gallery
seven and a half miles long, with rooms for
the officers opening out on either side of the
long passageways.</p>

<p>One morning the Canadian troops started
up the long sloping hillside, under skies that
rained cartridges, shells and gas bombs. So
terrific was the machine-gun fire that some
cartridges cut trees in two as if they had
been cut with a saw, while others did not so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
much strike the Canadian boys as cut their
bodies into two parts.</p>

<p>Lying upon their faces they crawled up
the hillside, cutting the wires as they crept
forward. Not until the second afternoon
did the shattered remnants reach the German
trench that crowned the hillcrest. Then
they plunged down into the trench, while
the Germans rushed down the long stairs
into the underground chamber and fled
through the lower openings of their long
gallery northward towards safety.</p>

<p>Not until the Canadian officers led us into
one of those German chambers did we understand
the black tragedy. The room was
shell-proof. The soft yellow clay was shored
up by rough boards. All around the walls
were bunks. In that chamber the German
officers had kept the captive French and
Belgian girls. There were two cupboards
standing against the wall. One was made
of rough boards; the other was a large,
exquisitely carved walnut bureau for girls'
garments. When the German officers fled
from the trench above they had just time to
escape to the lower shell-proof rooms, grab
some of the treasure and flee. Unwilling
to give these captive girls their freedom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
since they could not have the girls they determined
that their French and Belgian fathers
and sweethearts should not recover
them.</p>

<p>There was just time during the excitement
of the flight to unlock the door, rush in and
send a bullet through each young woman.
A few minutes later the Canadian boys
swarmed through the long connecting
chambers and side rooms.</p>

<p>In one of those rooms they found these
young women now dead or dying. Gas
bombs had already been flung down and
the rooms were foul with poisoned air. Protected
by their masks the Canadian boys
had time to pick up these girls and carry
them up the steps into the open air, where
they laid them down on the grass in the
open sunshine. But help came too late.
Beginning with an attempt to murder the
souls of the girls the German officers had
ended by slaying their bodies.</p>

<p>An officer saw to it that the official
photographer kept the record of the faces of
these dead girls. Once they must have been
divinely beautiful, for all were lovely beyond
the average. One could understand
the pride and joy of a father or lover when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he looked upon the young girl's face. The
slender body made one think of the tall lily
stem, crowned with that flower named the face
and glorious head. Strangely enough they
seemed to sleep as if peace had come, after
long pain. Plainly death had been longed for.</p>

<p>Weeks passed by. The photographs of
the dead girls were shown in the hope that
if possible word might reach their parents,
but no friend had been found to recognize
them. One day a Canadian officer, making
slow recovery in a hospital near the coast,
was asked by his nurse for the photograph.</p>

<p>It seemed there was a Belgian woman
working in the hospital. Her village had
been entirely destroyed. Her home was
gone and all whom she loved had disappeared.
By some accident the Red Cross
nurse remembered this photograph and decided
to show it to the Belgian woman who
had passed so swiftly from abundance and
happiness to the utmost of poverty and
heart-break. Almost unwillingly at first the
woman looked at the print. A moment
later she held the picture out at arm's
length, rose to her feet, then drew it to her
lips and hugged it to her breast.</p>

<p>With streaming eyes she almost shouted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
"Thank God! Julia is dead! Thank God!
Julia is dead! Now I know there is a God
in Israel, for Julia is dead, is dead&mdash;is dead!
Thank God! Thank God!"</p>

<p>Though for a long time the doves had
been in the clutches of the German hawks;
though for a long time the lambs had been
in the jaws of the German wolves; when all
else failed death came and released the lovely
girls from the clutch of German assassins.</p>


<h3>6. "Why Did You Leave Us in Hell
for Two Years?"</h3>

<p>For British soldiers it had been a long
trying day on Messines Ridge. For many
nights the boys had been coming up towards
the front trenches. The next morning at
3:50 they were to go "over the top"; a
feat which they accomplished, driving in a
mile and a half deep, on a long, long line,
only to be stopped by four days and nights
of rain that drowned the trenches and drove
them back out of the flooded valley to the
hillside. Because the Germans knew what
must come the next day, the German cannon
were trying to bomb out the British guns.</p>

<p>That night&mdash;tired out&mdash;we drove back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
eighteen miles behind the line for one good
night's sleep. After dinner an English lieutenant
told me this tragic tale:</p>

<p>"It was an April night last spring. All
day the wind and fog and rain had been
coming in from the North Sea. The chill
and damp went into the very marrow of the
bones. When night fell a few of us officers
crept down the long stair into a shell-proof
room. There we had our pipes and gossiped
about the events of the day and talked
with the French captain, our guest, who was
spending a week studying our sector. Finally
the time came when we must go back into
the trench to take our turn in the rain.</p>

<p>"We were putting on our raincoats, when
in my happiness I said, 'Well, men, you
should congratulate me. One week from
to-night I shall not be here in this rain and
mud. I shall be home in England and have
my little wife and my baby girl. Just one
week! It seems like seven eternities instead
of seven days and nights!'</p>

<p>"I little dreamed the little tragedy that I
had precipitated. My colonel was very kind.
He told me that he would have his permission
in three more months. The rest of
the boys also said nice things. Suddenly we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
realized that the French captain was acting
very strangely and saying excited things
with his back towards us. We did not
know how we had insulted him, nor could
we understand what had happened. Finally
my colonel said to him:</p>

<p>"'Captain, I hope you will have your
vacation soon and have a chance to go home
and see your family.'</p>

<p>"He turned on us like a crazy man. He
put his fists in the air, he half shouted and
half sobbed at us.</p>

<p>"'How do you men dare talk to me
about going home? Your land has never
been invaded, nor your families ruined.
Home! How can I go home? The Germans
have had my town for a year. In
their retreat they carried away my little girl
and my young wife, and now the priest has
gotten word to me that in six weeks my little
girl and my young wife will both have babes
by the German beast who carried them off.'</p>

<p>"And then the Frenchman cursed God
and cursed the devil! Cursed the Kaiser
and cursed the Fatherland. Oh, it was so
terrible. Doctor, I often wonder how Americans
could have left the women and girls of
Belgium and France in hell for two and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
half years, while you men stood in safety
and in peace."</p>

<p>The historian will find it hard to answer
that question. History will have it to say
that England was the good Samaritan who
helped the Belgians who had fallen among
thieves, while Americans were among those
who passed by on the other side.</p>


<h3>7. "This War Will End Within Forty
Years"</h3>

<p>A New Zealand officer was giving directions
to a group of his soldiers. They were
in the field at the foot of Bapaume. The
immediate task was that of cutting and rolling
up the barbed wire. In that territory the
Germans had left trenches foul with fever,
wells filled with the corpses of men and
horses, springs polluted with every form of
filth, but worst of all, the barbed wire entanglements.
Every sharp point was covered
with rust and threatened lockjaw. Looking
in every direction, the whole land was
yellow with the barbed wire. The work
was dangerous. The rebound of the wire
threatened the eye with its vision, threatened
the face and the hand, and all the soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
were in a mood of rebellion. In an angry
mood, the officer exclaimed, "There are a
hundred million miles of German barbed
wire in France!"</p>

<p>And when later I asked the first lieutenant
how long this war would last, he made the
instant answer, "This war will continue forty
years more! One year for the fighting, and
thirty-nine years to roll up the wire."</p>

<p>Because every soldier at the front hated
the wire entanglements, that bright sentence
ran up and down the entire line from Belgium
to the Swiss frontier. And for men
of experience there is more truth in the
statement than one would at first blush
think. It will take one more year for the
fighting, but it will take thirty-nine years
more to grow the shade trees. Five centuries
ago the French began to develop the
love of the beautiful. On either side of the
roads running across the land they planted
two rows of poplars, oaks or elms. When
long time had passed the fame of the French
roads and the shade trees went out into all
the earth. Under these trees the French
farmer stopped his cart, fed his horses and
refreshed himself beneath the shade. Under
these trees the old men at the end of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
career rested themselves, and gossiped about
old friends that had gone.</p>

<p>And when the German found he could not
hold the land and enjoy the shade trees, the
splendid orchards, the purple vineyards, he
determined that the Frenchman should not
have them, and so he lifted the axe upon
every peach and pear, plum and grape,
cherry and gooseberry tree. Perhaps it was
as black a crime to murder the land as it was
to murder the bodies of the farmers, since
the soul is immortal.</p>

<p>"One more year of fighting and thirty-nine
years" not to roll up the wire, but to
rebuild the cathedrals and churches, the
colleges and universities, the halls of science,
the temples of art, the mills for the weaving
of cotton and linen and wool, and above all
for the rebuilding of the railways, the reconstruction
of the canals and the bridges,
great and small. But the most grievous loss
is the human loss. Think of 1,500,000
crippled heroes and poor wounded invalids
in the land of France alone! Think of another
1,500,000 young widows, or lovers
and mothers! Gone the young men who
promised so great things for the French
essay, the French poem, for the paintings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and the bronzes! Dead the young lawyers,
physicians and educators! Gone the young
farmers and husbandmen! Perished 1,000,000
old people and 500,000 little children,
all dead of heart-break. The German beast
has been in the land. Like a wolf leaping
into the sheepfold to tear the throats of the
young lambs and the mother ewes.</p>

<p>What! Thirty-nine years more to recover
ruined France and Belgium, Poland and
Rumania? France will never be the same
again. The scar of the beast will abide.
That is why no man of large mind and
great heart will ever make friends with a
soldier from Germany, will ever buy an
article of German stamp, so long as he lives,
will ever read another German book, or
support another German business. It is our
duty to forgive the transgressor who is
repentant, but it is a crime to forget the unspeakable
atrocities, the devilish cruelties of
the German Kaiser, the German War Staff
and the German army, with its 10,000,000
criminals.</p>


<h3>8. "Why Are We Outmanned by the
Germans?"</h3>

<p>Many thoughtful men have lingered long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
over the despatches announcing that Great
Britain called thirty thousand farmers to the
trenches, thus threatening the loss of a part
of her harvest. One of the British editors
and statesmen explains this event by the
frank statement that for the moment the
Allies are outmanned, and will be until
another million Americans reach France.
Many men are puzzled to understand what
this means, but the explanation is very
simple. The combined population of Germany,
Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria is not
far from 140,000,000. To this must be
added seventy millions of conquered and impressed
peoples of Belgium, Poland, Rumania,
with the Baltic provinces of Russia,
Ukraine and other regions. Over against
this population stands the 125,000,000 living
in Great Britain, France, Italy, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the English
people of South Africa, and India, and the
Isles of the Sea. Concede, therefore, that
the army of six millions of Allies are over
against six millions of Germans. Why are
we outmanned?</p>

<p>Back of that British editor-statesman's
statement lies a most dramatic fact. Our
Allies keep their treaties, and will not use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
German prisoners to fight against their brothers.
Therefore the six million of Allies' soldiers
have no support behind them. But
the Germans impress all conquered peoples
and lifted into the air if the observer had a
glass powerful enough, he would behold
back of the German six millions another six
millions of impressed prisoners and conquered
peoples, who support the German
army. These men, driven forward by an
automatic pistol and the rifle, work within
half a mile of the rear German trench.
They dig ditches, fill shell holes, repair
roads, bring up burdens, care for the horses,
scrub the mud from the wagons, and the
slightest neglect of the task means that they
are shot down by the German guards. All
this releases the German soldier from the
deadly work that breaks the nerve, and unfits
a man to go over the top. That means
that the German soldier can fight eight
hours, and have sixteen for rest and recreation.</p>

<p>But over against this German army fighting
eight hours, with the deadly work
wrought by several million of impressed
servants and slaves, stands the Allied army.
But our men after eight hours of active service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
must then begin to dig ditches, fill shell
holes, repair bridges, clean the mud from
the wagons, bring up the munitions, and
this deadly work for eight hours, added to
their eight hours of active service, means
only eight hours for sleep and recovery,
while the German has sixteen hours off duty
for recovery and sleep. The Allies keep
their treaties, and do not ask a German
prisoner to fight against his brother. The
Allies obey the laws of right and wrong,
but the Ten Commandments are a great
handicap in time of war. Is there any one
who supposes that six million of Allied soldiers,
working sixteen hours a day, are as
fresh and as fit as six million Germans,
working only eight hours a day? That is
why the situation is so perilous. Fortunately
victories are not won by muscle without
but by the soul within. The sense of
justice in the heart lends a form of omnipotence
to a youth. In a moral universe,
therefore, we must win. The great problem
is, how to carry on until we can get another
million Americans across to France, with full
equipment, and fifty thousand aeroplanes.</p>

<h2 class="lu">"OVER HERE"</h2>

<h2>VI</h2>


<h3>1. The Redemption of a Slacker</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Out</span> on the Ohio River there is a large
steel town. During the last few years
many foreigners who have the Bolsheviki
spirit have crossed the ocean and found work
in the great shops and factories. Little by
little the foreign newspapers have developed
the spirit that has now ruined Russia,
and is here under the American name of the
I. W. W. movement. In this steel city was
an anarchist, with real power to move the
mobs. The mere mention of the name of
Carnegie or Rockefeller was to him like
waving a red flag in the face of a bull. In
the evenings it was his custom to climb
upon a box at the corner of the street, close
to a little park, and tell his hearers that all
the wealth in the rich man's house was
created by the workman's muscle. He made
no allowance for the inventor, for the organizer,
for the risks taken by the man who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
built a factory. A few weeks ago this anarchist
laid down a newspaper, containing an
account of the trial of the I. W. W. leaders
in Chicago. That night, becoming alarmed,
lest he himself be caught in the drag-net, and
perhaps forced to enlist as an enemy alien,
this agitator disappeared, leaving behind him
his board bill, laundry bill, tailor's bill, not
to mention many other forms of indebtedness&mdash;a
disappearance that led every one of
his creditors to give up any and all faith in
the American Bolsheviki movement.</p>

<p>Now there was a young boy of about
twenty-three who had long been listening to
this agitator. When, therefore, the second
night after the anarchist's disappearance
came, this young man, who aspired himself
to be a leader of the mob, climbed up on the
soap box, at the corner of the little park, and
began to speak to the same old crowd.</p>

<p>"Think of it, my friends! Just think of
it! Think of some soldier coming in here and
making me enlist! I have no grudge against
the Germans. I don't want to kill them. My
forefathers were all German! My name is
German. And I am an American all right,
all right! Still, I don't propose to have
anybody tell me what I must do. If I want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
to enlist, I will enlist, and if I don't, I won't!
I'd like to see some Government agent come
along and grab me for the draft! When he
comes, he'll hear a few things from me, and
then some!"</p>

<p>At that point a man lifted up his hand
and said: "Now you may stop right there!"
Throwing back his coat collar, he showed a
little metal badge. Climbing up on the box,
the stranger took the young anarchist by his
shoulder and half choked him, saying: "So
you want to have the people see some one
take you to the draft office? Well," said
the officer, "now's the time for them to see
him, and I'm the man. And you people,"
he went on, "just take a good look at this
fellow. It'll be the last chance you're going
to have, for he will be in jail to-night, and
to-morrow we will decide whether or not he
has been opposing the draft. If he has, he
stands a good chance of being shot." Blowing
a little whistle, the officer dragged the
young anarchist to the edge of the street,
half lifted and half kicked him into the
police wagon, which soon disappeared. The
enemy aliens who remained behind were
stupefied, partly with astonishment and
partly with terror. Aliens began to say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
"What will come next?" That night a
number more of pro-Germans disappeared
from this town with its steel mills.</p>

<p>The next morning, at ten o'clock, the officer
entered the jail. "Get a move on you,
young man!" he said brusquely. "You're
going up to the court to be examined to see
whether you are a slacker or a traitor. In
the one case you will be interned and in the
other case you will be hanged or shot."</p>

<p>The young anarchist was on his feet in a
moment. "But, officer, aren't you going to
give me a chance to enlist?"</p>

<p>"Young man, this Government does not
want traitors to enlist, nor pro-Germans."</p>

<p>"I am not a pro-German this morning,"
cried the excited man. "I have thought
the whole thing over last night. I did not
sleep a wink. I think this Government is
the best government in the world. And I
am willing to fight for it."</p>

<p>The officer was astounded. "Well, my
young enemy," he exclaimed, "a dungeon
seems to have had a good effect upon your
mind. What has regenerated you? Was it
the cold water or the corn bread? Or the
steel door before your dungeon? Or was it
the bad air in your cell? Or possibly it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the fear of death, or God Almighty, or future
punishment. Come now, out with it!"</p>

<p>It was a thoroughly frightened boy who
stood half an hour later in the prisoner's
dock. "Give me some book on the Government
of the United States," he exclaimed
to the judge. "And give me a week in which
to show that I am in earnest, and I will
then volunteer." The judge was very grave.
"Young man," he said sternly, "any boy
that will eat the bread of the United States,
that will enjoy the liberty of this country,
and has had all the chances to climb to
place that have come to you, and refuses to
enlist, has something wrong with him, and
it is only a question of time when he comes
to the judgment day." To this the young
man made the answer that he had been lazy,
careless and ignorant; that he had allowed
himself to become the tool of the runaway
agitator, and then once more he asked that
he might have a chance to enlist. With the
help of friends, the judge and the draft
board finally let him off and sent him to a
camp for three months' intensive training.
Then came the news that his company had
been sent over seas, and within a short time
thereafter in the list of casualties the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of this young foreigner appeared. But one
letter reached this country, and that letter
was notable for this sentence: "For the first
time in my life I have had young Americans
for my companions. The boys in my company
have had a college education and they
have taught me bravery, truth, self-sacrifice,
kindness and chivalry. I have learned more
in two months at the camp than in all the
rest of my life put together. The companionship
in my company and in my camp
have saved my soul." It is this that explains
the redemption of the slacker.</p>


<h3>2. Slackers versus Heroes</h3>

<p>Going through the long communication
trench, between the ruined city of Rheims
and an observation lookout, with its view of
the German front trench, we passed several
soldiers digging an opening in the soft white
marl, into a parallel trench. The captain
in charge called my attention to a French
poilu. His hair was quite black, save for
the half inch next to the scalp and that was
white as snow. If one had lifted up his hair
and estimated his age by the last two inches
of the jet locks the poilu would have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
about thirty-five, but the hair, pure white at
the roots, and a glance at his face told us
that he was fifty-five to sixty.</p>

<p>"He passed inspection," said the captain,
"by dyeing his hair, and several weeks ago
he broke the bottle of dye. Now he is half
scared to death for fear he will be thrown
out, because he is at the beginning of old
age. Still I have no better soldier, no
stronger, braver man. But I am hoping
much from a friend in Epernay, to whom I
sent for a bottle of black hair dye."</p>

<p>So long as the Frenchmen have that
spirit France will never be defeated.</p>

<p>Many weeks ago I was in a manufacturing
town near Pittsburgh. The wind was sharp
and chill. All overcoats were turned up
at the collar. On a box stood a young
Australian lieutenant. His cheeks held
two fiery spots. He was telling the story
of the second battle of Ypres. While he
talked you walked with him the streets of
the doomed city, you heard the crash of the
great shells as they smashed through the
public buildings; you witnessed the burning
of the Cloth Hall and shivered as the noble
structure fell. One laughed with him in his
moments of humour and wept over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
sorrows of the refugees. He pleaded with
the Welshmen and the Cornishmen, and told
them that the motherland was bleeding to
death and that now every boy counted. He
flogged his hearers, scoffed at them, praised
them, wept, laughed, reviled, transformed
and finally conquered them.</p>

<p>At the close, shaking hands with him, lo!
he was burning with fever, with skin hot
and dry. "Lieutenant, you should be at the
hotel, in bed. You will kill yourself speaking
in this cold air."</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "there are plenty
of our boys who are perfectly sound who
will be killed inside of three months. I have
the t. b., (tuberculosis), but I believe that
I can pull through a year. I have enlisted
over one hundred coal miners from Wales
and iron-workers from Cornwall. I am willing
to die for the motherland, after a
year of t. b., since my pals will be dead
within three months through bullets. And
when I die I want to die with the consciousness
that I have kept my manhood."</p>

<p>I left that poor, wounded, half-dead
young soldier with the feeling that I had
been in the presence of a superior being.</p>

<p>Over against these heroes stand the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
slackers. There are hundreds and thousands
of young men from allied countries
who are of draft age, who find refuge in this
land. There are other thousands who have
been exempted, one because he has a flat instep,
another because he has had trouble with
his eyes or his teeth; or has tuberculosis, in
its initial form, or is a victim of bronchitis.
Most of these men owe it to their country
and themselves to tear up their exemption
papers. They earn their living in this country,
working ten hours a day, but they will
not work six or eight hours a day for Old
England, thus releasing some young man to
go to the front.</p>

<p>The question is not whether the youth has
an exemption paper. The heart of the question
is, Has he any moral right to accept an
exemption? This war is being fought by
untold thousands of soldiers who could obtain
half a dozen exemptions. They prefer
to run the risk of death in six months, to
looking after their own hides and keeping
well away from danger for the next six
years or sixty. No one who has been in the
coal regions or in the great mines of the
Rocky Mountains but realizes that there are
an enormous number of allied slackers in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
this country. They have left their country
to its dire peril at a moment when Old England
is bleeding to death&mdash;when every man
counts and when the cripples, the invalids,
the old men, the women, everybody who can
give four hours or eight of work a day
should enter the great war offices or commissary
departments and do office work, and
thus release the stronger men for their work
at the front.</p>

<p>The time has fully come when Americans
should ask themselves the question whether
or not they have a moral right to support
with money that could be far better used, in
the war stamp purchases or Red Cross work,
all these slackers and cowards, at a time when
the motherland asks them to throw away
their exemption papers, in an hour when
civilization, liberty and humanity are treasures
trembling in the balance.</p>


<h3>3. German Stupidity in Avoiding the
Draft</h3>

<p>Following the revolution of 1848 in Germany,
multitudes of people fled from Prussia
and Bavaria, and these fugitives, settling in
the United States, organized colonies that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
grew until there were often one hundred
families in a single community. Strangely
enough, as the years went on, these Germans
forgot the iron yoke they once had borne,
until, when many years had passed by, it
came about that time and distance lent a
glamour to the landscape of the far-off
Fatherland. Occasional letters from their
relatives kept them in touch with the old
German home. At last they quite forgot
the militarism, the poverty, the cruel limitations
and the hypocrisy of Germany. Familiarity
also with the institutions of the
Republic bred a kind of contempt. Through
the imagination Germany became an enchanted
land. When, therefore, war was
declared these German-Americans came together
in their clubs, beer gardens and German
churches, to pledge unswerving fealty
to the Kaiser and to the militarism from
which once they had fled as from death
itself.</p>

<p>Last summer brought the Government
draft to the young men of one of these German
colonies. The week was approaching
when the German boys must have their
physical examination. American officers,
American physicians and the members of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
draft board were already in session in a certain
town. One Sunday a German-American
physician appeared in that community.
That night some twenty or more young German-Americans
met that physician. He
told them plainly how deeply he sympathized
with their unwillingness to turn their
guns against their own German cousins and
relatives in the Fatherland. Out of pity and
compassion had been born his plan to save
their limbs and perhaps their lives, and also
to serve the Fatherland and the beloved
Kaiser. "I have here," said the physician,
"a certain heart depressant. It will slow
your heart like the brake on an automobile.
It is a simple coal-oil product. It is quite
harmless. It was made by the well-known
German firm of Baer &amp; Company, chemists,
and it is so cheap. I shall see to it that you
are rejected for the draft. And&mdash;think of
it!&mdash;only twenty-five dollars! For that
little sum I will keep you from being
wounded or killed. You will each one give
me twenty-five dollars; then I will give you
this bottle, holding five grains for Monday,
ten grains for Tuesday, fifteen grains for
Wednesday, twenty grains for Thursday,
twenty-five grains for Friday, and on Saturday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
you will be rejected." Ten minutes
later the necromancer had juggled twenty-five
dollars out of the pocket of each newly
drafted boy and into his own right-hand
pocket.</p>

<p>On Saturday these young men appeared
before the draft board and the Government
physicians. All the boys were in a dreadful
condition nervously. Now the heart would
drop to forty, and then at the slightest exertion
run up to two hundred and twenty. All
were dizzy, nauseated, yellow and green,
feverish. But the Secret Service men knew
every detail of what had taken place, and all
the facts were in the hands of the draft
board. A certain farmer's son, young Heinrich
H&mdash;&mdash;, was first examined. The United
States physician counted a pulse that varied
from forty to two hundred and twenty. The
physician kept his face perfectly straight.
"Marvellous heart! Regular as a clock!
Strong as the throbbing of a locomotive.
Seventy-two exactly! Absolutely normal.
I congratulate you, young men, upon your
fine heart action. A man is as old as his
heart engine. A boy with a heart like yours
ought to live to be a hundred years old. All
you need is a change of climate. France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
will do the world for you. You may need a
little heart stimulant, but I think that nothing
hastens the pulse beat like a few rifle
balls and bomb shells from Hindenburg."
He sent every one of the twenty boys into
the service, but separated them, one going
to Camp Ayer, in Massachusetts; one to
Camp Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, and the rest
to camps in States between. In one Middle
West community a German father and son
went so far as to deaden pain through cocaine
and then cut off the finger of the right
hand. It is generally understood that both
the father and son are now in two widely
separated penitentiaries, reflecting each in
his own cell upon the folly of treason and
the crime of becoming a traitor to the kindest
and best Government that has ever been
organized upon our earth.</p>


<h3>4. "I'm Working Now for Uncle
Sam"</h3>

<p>The long transatlantic train came to a
dead stop at the division station in that
great Southwestern State, where one was
surrounded by sage-brush, the sand, the distant
foot-hills and the far-off mountain range.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the Pullman cars showed signs of
a hot box, and a moment later the wheel
burst into a mass of flame. In the thirty
minutes' wait for repairs I made my way
into the room where the conductors, engineers
and firemen met. On a little table I
found a copy of the address given before the
railroad men of El Paso, Texas, by Secretary
McAdoo.</p>

<p>I called the attention of the different men
to the address, to the clarity of the reasoning,
the simplicity of the argument, the
strength of the appeal and the glowing
patriotism that filled all the pages. The
pamphlet had been worn by much reading.
It was covered with the black finger prints
of busy men who had been working around
the locomotives and tenders.</p>

<p>Plainly Mr. McAdoo's speech had made
a profound impression upon these employees.
Having first of all called the
attention of the large group of men to the
creative work of Alexander Hamilton, the
first Secretary of the Treasury, who struck,
as Daniel Webster said, "the dry rock of
national credit and abundant streams of
revenue gushed forth," I asked these men
whether there had been in one hundred and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
twenty-five years any forward movement in
finance that was comparable to the benefits
derived from the national reserve bank law,
under Secretary McAdoo, a law that not only
had prevented a panic in this country during
this war, but had raised more billions within
four years than the total cost of the Government
in the first century of our existence.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, on the train, the conductor
sought me out. In the midst of the
discussion he drew out a roll of bills. He
told me that in those mountain towns many
of the ranchers did not buy their tickets at
the stations.</p>

<p>To use his expression, "They had it in for
the railroads." "They pay me their fare in
cash, and when I give them the receipt they
tear up the receipt and wink at me. I always
feel," he said, "like resenting these
actions, because I know that they are incitements
to petty theft, but now," he said, "I
have my chance. I always tell them," said
the conductor, "that money belongs to
Uncle Sam. He runs this railroad, Uncle
Sam takes this money.</p>

<p>"With it he will buy guns for the American
boys at the front and build ships to
carry food that will feed these soldiers. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
would rather lose that right arm than take
one penny of money that belongs to Uncle
Sam. This is my job to run this train. I
tell my crew every day that we must make
the coal produce every possible pound of
steam, that every waste must be saved, and
every pound of energy used and that we must
run this train so as to help win this war."</p>

<p>From morning till night I found that conductor
was preaching that sentiment. His
words were directly traceable to the words
of Secretary McAdoo at El Paso, Texas.
That single speech transformed these men.</p>

<p>Measured by the results&mdash;truth that transforms
life and changes conduct and character&mdash;that
was a truly great speech. We must
all hope much from this new sense of devotion
to the interests of Uncle Sam.</p>


<h3>5. The German Farmer's Debt to the
United States</h3>

<p>There are literally thousands of small
German colonies in different parts of this
country. In one far distant State is a community
settled by about two hundred German
families, who took up the land immediately
after the Civil War.</p>

<p>By some good fortune they settled in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
what is now one of the very richest sections
in the United States. Land that they bought
for $1.25 an acre is now worth $250 an acre.
In that community there are two German
churches.</p>

<p>Both pastors came from Germany, both
were educated in German colleges, both read
German newspapers and both insist upon
carrying on a colloquial German school,
with German teachers, German text-books
and German standards.</p>

<p>Little pressure was brought to bear upon
these farmers during the First Liberty Loan.
By many devices they succeeded in getting
their boys away before the draft registration.
While it was never proved technically
that they had all pledged themselves not to
oppose Germany, morally this is known to
be the fact.</p>

<p>October of 1917 came and the Second
Liberty Loan was on. One day all these
farmers received a printed card, saying there
would be a meeting on Monday night, in
connection with the Second Liberty Loan.
"I find you made no subscription whatsoever
to the First Liberty Loan. There are
reasons why I think it best for me to advise
you to attend this meeting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Every German farmer read that card
several times. Who was this stranger who
was coming into the community? Was he
a Secret Service man? How did he find out
that there had been a secret meeting of the
Germans immediately after war had been declared
against Germany? Each farmer began
to ask himself: "Has any one quoted me?"
Each one decided to attend that meeting.</p>

<p>The meeting began at precisely seven
o'clock. Only one man who had received
the notice was absent, and his son brought a
message concerning his father's absence.
The stranger arose in his place, but left it
uncertain as to whether he was a Secret
Service man, a banker or a patriot interested
in his country. He began with substantially
these words:</p>

<p>"Men, you are all German-Americans.
I find that not one of you subscribed to the
First Liberty Loan. You came to this
country poor men. This Government sold
you Government land for from a dollar and
a quarter to two dollars and a half an acre.
But you seem to have forgotten one thing.
Your title deed to your farm rests upon your
loyalty as citizens of the Republic. Whenever
you refuse to support the people of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Republic you have by your own act annulled
the title deed of your land.</p>

<p>"If you refuse to support your Government
in this war, you are a traitor, and
when this is proved you will be shot. If
secretly you have been sending money to
the Kaiser to buy guns with which to kill
American boys you have forfeited the title
deed to your farm. Your property has become
again the possession of the Government
and people of the United States."</p>

<p>By this time these farmers had their
mouths open, and their faces became tense
and alarmed. When his words had had
time to sink in, the stranger went on: "I
have here a statement as to the number of
acres in each farm owned by each man in
this room. The first man's name is Heinrich
----; you own 320 acres of land. It
is worth at least $75,000. There is no
mortgage on this farm. Heinrich, I think
you had better buy $2,500 worth of Liberty
Bonds. I am simply advising with you as a
friend. I have made out an application for
you, and all you have to do is to sign it.</p>

<p>"My advice to every one of you is that
you buy from three to five per cent, of the
value of your farm. I want to say incidentally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
that I trust that there will never again
be held a secret meeting of the Germans in
this room to discuss the best way to avoid
supporting the United States Government in
this war against Germany, and how you can
best help the Kaiser."</p>

<p>That little sentence worked like magic.
Every farmer in the room rose to his feet in
his anxiety to rush forward to the table.
Men literally struggled to see who should
sign up first. Their enthusiasm for the
United States Government was as boundless
as it was sudden in its manifestation.</p>

<p>Remember that there were only two hundred
farmers in the room. And yet there
are the best of reasons for believing that the
men in that room bought that night nearly
$200,000 worth of Liberty Bonds.</p>


<h3>6. "Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth" Is
an Ungrateful Immigrant</h3>

<p>One of the things that no patriot can ever
understand is the ingratitude of the Germans
who fled from the Fatherland to escape German
militarism and autocracy.</p>

<p>Lecturing in a Western State, I met a
banker who had returned from a schoolhouse
in a rural district where he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
talking about the Liberty Bonds to a German
audience. One old German refused to
attend this meeting. He was very bitter in
his attacks upon our Government. He had
made no subscription to the first two Liberty
Loans; he had refused to help in the campaign
for the Red Cross Fund; he insisted
that he paid his taxes and that was all that
the Government had any right to demand
from him.</p>

<p>He went one step further: The old man
said that he had not read a single American
newspaper since the war began, and that
nothing but a German newspaper should
cross his threshold until the war ended.
Not until that banker descended upon this
pro-German with the indignation of an outraged
patriot did the rich old farmer capitulate.</p>

<p>The story of that German is typical. He
came to this country about 1859. When the
homestead act was passed he received from
the United States one hundred and sixty
acres of land in the very centre of one of
the richest States in this Union, and his one
hundred and sixty acre farm is now worth
about $100,000.</p>

<p>When he ran away from Germany he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was receiving twenty cents a day. He rose
at daybreak, cleaned stables, milked cows,
toiled in the field, began his milking after
dark, worked sixteen hours a day, had nothing
to eat except what could not be sold by
his employer. He was a German plebeian,
with no chance ever to improve his condition.
He was ignorant, stupid, a mere beast
of burden.</p>

<p>So the German boy slipped across the line
into Holland, came steerage to this country,
slept among the rats of the ship, but the
people of the United States welcomed that
miserable refugee. The American school,
without any charge, gave him four months'
instruction every winter until he was twenty.
The American people gave him a farm as
a free gift. This Republic educated his children,
his grandchildren and enriched them
with land, office, honours and wealth. Once
he hated autocracy and militarism in the
Fatherland&mdash;but in 1918 he loved them.</p>

<p>No sooner did the Kaiser invade Belgium
and commit rape upon that land than this
German farmer passed through a revulsion.
Whatever the Kaiser did was right. If
Germany did a thing it was proper. Germany
had a right to break her solemn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
treaties; Germany had a right to sink the
<i>Lusitania</i>; if Germany was out of iron ore
she had a right to invade France and steal
her iron mines. What had been crimes suddenly
became virtues.</p>

<p>Fleeing from the German tyrant in 1859,
in 1918 the old farmer turned upon the
United States that had befriended him.</p>

<p>"If I have to make my choice, I choose
the Kaiser."</p>

<p>Mentally, it seems absurd. Morally, his
was a monstrous position. But blood was
thicker than water. Gratitude had no place
in his heart.</p>

<p>This old German regarded the gift of his
farm by our people as a sign of weakness.
The Republic gave him a homestead because
he was a superior man. He actually had a
belief that Germany would soon overrun the
world; that the Kaiser would soon be enthroned
in Washington; that some German
in Iowa would supersede the Government in
Des Moines, and he was simply getting ready,
having made friends with the Kaiser's Government,
to receive reward when the United
States became a German colony.</p>

<p>Who can explain the obsession?</p>

<p>It is clear that the German-Americans had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
been drilled for forty years through their
German newspapers in these ideas. Little
by little they have been alienated from the
institutions of the Republic. Slowly they
have been led to believe that Berlin is soon
to be a world capital and Kaiser Wilhelm
the world emperor, while only Germans
shall be allowed in this country to hold
office or land, while all Americans become
tenants and servitors thereto.</p>

<p>Plainly this is what Siebert meant in his
book, published five years ago in Berlin:</p>

<p>"When we have reached our goal Germany
must see to it that no race save the
German race can have a title deed in land
or carry weapons, just as in the first world
empire no one but a Roman was allowed to
own land or have a sword or spear."</p>


<h3>7. In Praise of Our Secret Service</h3>

<p>Of necessity our Secret Service work is
carried on in silence and without blare of
trumpets. The achievements of the Department
of Justice cannot be proclaimed from
the housetops. Everybody knows something
about the crimes committed by the
German agents. These spies, loyal with
their lips, have in their hearts plotted innumerable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
crimes against our Government.
They have dynamited our factories and
warehouses; they have burned shops and
planted bombs on ships; they have thrown
trains from the track; they have poisoned
the horses and mules upon the transports en
route to France; they have fouled the
springs of knowledge through their hired
reporters; with all the cunning developed by
long practice, they have spread their insidious
and perilous influences into the remotest
regions of the land. But over against these
spies and secret agents have stood the
United States Secret Service men, and with
everything in favour of the German plotter,
our defenders have beaten the German at
his own game.</p>

<p>War was declared against Germany on
April 6, 1917. One Sunday night two or
three weeks later a large company of German-Americans
belonging to the secret German
league met in their accustomed place of
assembly. There were several hundred Germans
present, but among them were three
Secret Service men. The German lawyer
who opened the meeting was very bitter.
Having made certain that only German
sympathizers were present, he went on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
say that the occasion of this war could be
traced to Wall Street. Certain rich bankers
and American plutocrats had loaned perhaps
a billion dollars to England. Since the war
was going against England, these rich men
were afraid that they would lose their investment.
In their emergency they forced war
upon Congress. The speech was clever,
specious, cunning, shrewdly calculated to stir
up passion. And the speech was applauded
to the echo. The second speaker made a no
less skillful appeal to the prejudices of the
members of the secret German-American
league. Since the war was a money war,
originated by Wall Street, the Government
could be defeated as to its plans only by
money. Therefore, every member of the
league must make his contribution; no one
present but must give at least ten dollars.
And, he added, in view of the fact that it
was Sunday night and that some might be
without money, and since no checks could be
accepted, there were several German bankers
present, who would be glad to advance
money to the members who wished to make
cash contributions. The Germans had provided
in advance against every possible
emergency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the opportunity for the Secret
Service men. The first one arose and began
with an apology for a German brogue that
in reality he was assuming. He spared no
words in praising the first two speakers.
"What a wonderful man was the Kaiser!
What victories von Hindenburg had
achieved! The Fatherland was standing
with back against the wall. How wicked a
nation was France, and Poland! What a
black heart England had!" He pictured
Germany as a lamb with fleece as white as
snow, and a huge Belgian wolf jumping at
the lamb's tender throat. "What an ambitious
man was President Wilson. How
eagerly had Congress waited until Germany
was weak, and then rushed in to grab the
fruits of war!" When this man sat down
his hearers were in a state of rapturous upheaval.
But scarcely had his voice ceased
echoing in the air when the second Secret
Service man arose. Having complimented
the first two speeches by the German plotters,
he said that he thought he represented
the members in expressing the judgment that
the third speaker had made a speech that
was unrivalled in its statement as to the duty
of the members toward the Kaiser and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
beloved Fatherland. The second Secret
Service man, therefore, moved that it be the
sense of the meeting that the member who
had just spoken be made secretary of the
meeting, be custodian of the funds just contributed.
In five minutes he had all the
secrets of the meeting safely lodged in the
hands of the first Secret Service man. At
this point the third representative of the
Government arose and nominated the second
Secret Service speaker, who had just taken
his seat, as teller to count the funds, and in
recognition of this man's gifts the teller immediately
afterwards appointed the third
Secret Service man assistant teller. During
the next three hours, in the secrecy of their
own meeting, over twenty prosperous and
influential Germans committed themselves
against this Government.</p>

<p>About midnight the secretary and the two
tellers turned over to the two Germans who
had made the two big speeches at the opening
of the meeting the entire collection,
which amounted to thousands of dollars.
But at half-past twelve, as these two Germans
were entering their hotel, four Secret
Service men tapped them on the shoulder
and promptly relieved them of the aforementioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
thousands. One of these men is
now working out his sentence in a Southern
penitentiary and the other in a Western
penitentiary. Their sentences were for
twenty-eight years. The other men who
defended Germany and attacked the United
States are serving terms&mdash;some long and
some short. It is a proverb that the wicked
flee when no man pursueth. But Dr. Parkhurst
coined a striking sentence when he
added: "The wicked man makes better
time in fleeing when the righteous Secret
Service man pursues him with a sharp stick."</p>
